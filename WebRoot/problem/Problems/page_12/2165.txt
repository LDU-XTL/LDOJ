</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Consider a 3D scene with OXYZ coordinate system. Axis OX points to the right, axis OY points up, and axis OZ points away from you. There is a number of rectangular windows on the scene. The plane of each window is parallel to OXY , its sides are parallel to OX and OY . All windows are situated at different depths on the scene (different coordinates z > 0).
<br><center><img src=images/2165_1.jpg></center>
<br>A gunman with a rifle moves along OX axis (y = 0 and z = 0). He can shoot a bullet in a straight line. His goal is to shoot a single bullet through all the windows. Just touching a window edge is enough.
<br>Your task is to determine how to make such shot.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains a single integer number n (2 <= n <= 100) â€” the number of windows on the scene. The following n lines describe the windows. Each line contains five integer numbers x<sub>1i</sub>, y<sub>1i</sub>, x<sub>2i</sub>, y<sub>2i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub> (0 < x<sub>1i</sub>, y<sub>1i</sub>, x<sub>2i</sub>, y<sub>2i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub> < 1000). Here (x<sub>1i</sub>, y<sub>1i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub>) are coordinates of the bottom left corner of the window, and (x<sub>2i</sub>, y<sub>2i</sub>, z<sub>i</sub>) are coordinates of the top right corner of the window (x<sub>1i</sub> < x<sub>2i</sub>, y<sub>1i</sub> < y<sub>2i</sub>). Windows are ordered by z coordinate (z<sub>i</sub> > z<sub>i-1</sub> for 2 <= i <= n).</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output a single word "UNSOLVABLE" if the gunman cannot reach the goal of shooting a bullet through all the windows.
<br>Otherwise, on the first line output a word "SOLUTION". On the next line output x coordinate of the point from which the gunman must fire a bullet. On the following n lines output x, y, z coordinates of the points where the bullet goes through the consecutive windows. All coordinates in the output file must be printed with six digits after decimal point.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3
