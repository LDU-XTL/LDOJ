</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Suppose you are reading byte streams from any device, representing IP addresses. Your task is to convert a 32 characters long sequence of '1s' and '0s' (bits) to a dotted decimal format. A dotted decimal format for an IP address is form by grouping 8 bits at a time and converting the binary representation to decimal representation. Any 8 bits is a valid part of an IP address. To convert binary numbers to decimal numbers remember that both are positional numerical systems, where the first 8 positions of the binary systems are:
