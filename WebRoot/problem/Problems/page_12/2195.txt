</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">On a grid map there are n little men and n houses. In each unit time, every little man can move one unit step, either horizontally, or vertically, to an adjacent point. For each little man, you need to pay a $1 travel fee for every step he moves, until he enters a house. The task is complicated with the restriction that each house can accommodate only one little man.
<br>
<br>Your task is to compute the minimum amount of money you need to pay in order to send these n little men into those n different houses. The input is a map of the scenario, a '.' means an empty space, an 'H' represents a house on that point, and am 'm' indicates there is a little man on that point.

<br>You can think of each point on the grid map as a quite large square, so it can hold n little men at the same time; also, it is okay if a little man steps on a grid with a house without entering that house.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There are one or more test cases in the input. Each case starts with a line giving two integers N and M, where N is the number of rows of the map, and M is the number of columns. The rest of the input will be N lines describing the map. You may assume both N and M are between 2 and 100, inclusive. There will be the same number of 'H's and 'm's on the map; and there will be at most 100 houses.  Input will terminate with 0 0 for N and M.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output one line with the single integer, which is the minimum amount, in dollars, you need to pay. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2 2
