</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Beads of N colors are connected together into a circular necklace of N beads (N<=1000000000). Your job is to calculate how many different kinds of the necklace can be produced. You should know that the necklace might not use up all the N colors, and the repetitions that are produced by rotation around the center of the circular necklace are all neglected.
