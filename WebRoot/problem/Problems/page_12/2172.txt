To hide his work from his jailors he shall get rid of the bricks that he removes from the wall. All bricks have a shape of rectangular parallelepiped with the size of A * B * C inches and are so strong that they are impossible to break. However, there's a small rectangular sewer hole in the cell's floor with the size of D * E inches that goes deep down as a rectangular well of the same size (so deep it is, that its depth could not be measured and can be neglected). The prisoner have precisely (up to a tenth of an inch!) measured all the sizes A, B, C, D, E and wants to know if it is possible to dispose of the castle's bricks through the hole in the floor. Please, answer this question for him.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of a single line with 5 numbers A, B, C, D, and E separated by spaces.
