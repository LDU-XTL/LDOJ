</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The cows have been making movies lately, so they are ready to play a variant of the famous game "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon".
<br>
<br>The game works like this: each cow is considered to be zero degrees of separation (degrees) away from herself. If two distinct cows have been in a movie together, each is considered to be one 'degree' away from the other.  If a two cows have never worked together but have both worked with a third cow, they are considered to be two 'degrees' away from each other (counted as: one degree to the cow they've worked with and one more to the other cow).  This scales to the general case.
<br>
<br>The N (2 <= N <= 300) cows are interested in figuring out which cow has the smallest average degree of separation from all the other cows. excluding herself of course. The cows have made M (1 <= M <= 10000) movies and it is guaranteed that some relationship path exists between every pair of cows.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M
<br>
<br>* Lines 2..M+1: Each input line contains a set of two or more space-separated integers that describes the cows appearing in a single movie.  The first integer is the number of cows participating in the described movie, (e.g., Mi); the subsequent Mi integers tell which cows were.
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer that is 100 times the shortest mean degree of separation of any of the cows.
