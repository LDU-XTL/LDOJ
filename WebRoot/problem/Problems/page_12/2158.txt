</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Here is a difficult mathematics problem; your job is to solve it.
<br>
<br>Given two integer N and K, we have
<br>A(N, K) = {a | a = (a1 a2 a3 â€¦ aN),  ai  is integer and 0 <= ai <= K-1, i = 1,...,N}.
<br>
<br>We define a function d = Image(a) from A(N, K) to A(N-1, K) as below:
<br>For any a = (a1 a2 a3 ... aN), which is belonged to A(N, K), we have d = (d1 d2 ... d<sub>N-1</sub>) = Image(a) with di = min(ai, a<sub>i+1</sub>), i.e., di is the smaller one between ai and ai+1.
<br>
<br>You should calculate the expression below
<br><center><img src=images/2158_1.jpg></center>
<br>For any element a belonged to A(N, K), the expression first obtains d = (d1 d2 ... d<sub>N-1</sub>) = Image(a); then gain a value by calculating (d1+1)(d2+1)...(d<sub>N-1</sub>+1). Each a corresponding to a value, and f(N, K) is just the sum of these values.
<br>
<br>For example, If N = 2, K = 3, then A(N, K)={(00), (01), (02), (11), (10), (12), (20), (21), (22)}; the values obtained from each element in A(N, K) are 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and we can know that  f(2, 3) = 14 by adding these values.
