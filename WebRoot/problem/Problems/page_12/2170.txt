</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Lattice animal is a set of connected sites on a lattice. Lattice animals on a square lattice are especially popular subject of study and are also known as polyominoes. Polyomino is usually represented as a set of sidewise connected squares. Polyomino with n squares is called n-polyomino.
<br>In this problem you are to find a number of distinct free n-polyominoes that fit into rectangle w*h. Free polyominoes can be rotated and flipped over, so that their rotations and mirror images are considered to be the same.
<br>For example, there are 5 different pentominoes (5-polyominoes) that fit into 2*4 rectangle and 3 different octominoes (8-polyominoes) that fit into 3 * 3 rectangle.
