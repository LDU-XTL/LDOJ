</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">As an employee of the Macrohard Company, you have been asked to implement the new data structure that would be used to store some integer keys. 
<br>The keys must be stored in a special ordered collection that can be considered as an array A, which has an infinite number of locations, numbered starting from 1. Initially all locations are empty. The following operation must be supported by the collection: Insert(L, K), where L is the location in the array and K is some positive integer value. 
<br>The operation must be processed as follows: 
<br><ul><li>If A[L] is empty, set A[L] ← K. 
<br><li>If A[L] is not empty, perform Insert(L + 1, A[L]) and after that set A[L] ← K. </ul>
<br>Given N integer numbers L1 , L2 , . . . , LN you have to output the contents of the array after a sequence of the following operations: 
<br><blockquote>Insert(L1 , 1) 
<br>Insert(L2 , 2) 
<br>. . . 
<br>Insert(LN , N)</blockquote></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains N --- the number of Insert operations and M --- the maximal position that can be used in the Insert operation (1 <= N <= 131 072, 1 <= M <= 131 072). 
<br>Next line contains N integer numbers L i that describe Insert operations to be performed (1 <= Li <= M ). </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output the contents of the array after a given sequence of Insert operations. On the first line print W --- the number of the greatest location that is not empty. After that output W integer numbers --- A[1], A[2], . . . , A[W ]. Output zeroes for empty locations. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">5 4
