<br>Let's consider the real vector space formed by all polynomials in two variables of degree not greater than d invariant with respect to the rotation by 2π/n. Your task is to calculate the dimension of this vector space. 
<br>You might find useful the following remark: Any polynomial of degree not greater than d can be uniquely written in form
