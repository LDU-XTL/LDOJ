</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">If we input a number formed by 4 digits and these digits are not all of one same value, then it obeys the following law.  Let us operate the number in the following way:
<br>(1) Arrange the digits in the way from bigger to smaller, such that it forms the biggest number that could be made from these 4 digits;
<br>(2) Arrange the digits in the way from smaller to bigger, such that it forms the smallest number that could be made from these 4 digits (If there is 0 among these 4 digits, the number obtained may be less than four digits);
<br>(3) Find the difference of these two numbers that is a new four digital number.
<br>Repeat the above process, we can finally always get the result 6174 or 0.
<br>Please write the program to realize the above algorithm.
