</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Computing the exact number of ways that N things can be taken M at a time can be a great challenge when N and/or M become very large. Challenges are the stuff of contests. Therefore, you are to make just such a computation given the following: 
<br>GIVEN: 	5 <= N <= 100; 5 <= M <= 100; M <= N
<br>Compute the EXACT value of: 	C = N! / (N-M)!M!
<br>You may assume that the final value of C will fit in a 32-bit Pascal LongInt or a C long. For the record, the exact value of 100! is: 
<br> 93,326,215,443,944,152,681,699,238,856,266,700,490,715,968,264,381,621,        468,592,963,895,217,599,993,229,915,608,941,463,976,156,518,286,253,      697,920,827,223,758,251,185,210,916,864,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
