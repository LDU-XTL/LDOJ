</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Computer generated and assisted proofs and verification occupy a small niche in the realm of Computer Science. The first proof of the four-color problem was completed with the assistance of a computer program and current efforts in verification have succeeded in verifying the translation of high-level code down to the chip level. 
<br>This problem deals with computing quantities relating to part of Fermat's Last Theorem: that there are no integer solutions of a^n + b^n = c^n for n > 2. 
<br>Given a positive integer N, you are to write a program that computes two quantities regarding the solution of x^2 + y^2 = z^2, where x, y, and z are constrained to be positive integers less than or equal to N. You are to compute the number of triples (x,y,z) such that x < y < z, and they are relatively prime, i.e., have no common divisor larger than 1. You are also to compute the number of values 0 < p <= N such that p is not part of any triple (not just relatively prime triples).

The first integer is the number of relatively prime triples (such that each component of the triple is <=N). The second number is the number of positive integers <=N that are not part of any triple whose components are all <=N.
