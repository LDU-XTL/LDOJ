</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Suppose there are M people, including you, playing a special card game. At the beginning, each player receives N cards. The pip of a card is a positive integer which is at most N*M. And there are no two cards with the same pip. During a round, each player chooses one card to compare with others. The player whose card with the biggest pip wins the round, and then the next round begins. After N rounds, when all the cards of each player have been chosen, the player who has won the most rounds is the winner of the game.
<br>

<br>
<br>Given your cards received at the beginning, write a program to tell the maximal number of rounds that you may at least win during the whole game.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains two integers m (2?20) and n (1?50), representing the number of players and the number of cards each player receives at the beginning of the game, respectively. This followed by a line with n positive integers, representing the pips of cards you received at the beginning. Then a blank line follows to separate the cases. 
<br>
<br>The input is terminated by a line with two zeros.
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output a line consisting of the test case number followed by the number of rounds you will at least win during the game.
