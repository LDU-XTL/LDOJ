</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">It had been a year since Swamp County Computing established a functional programming group. Your (non-functional programming) group is going to throw a surprise party for the anniversary. Now the functional folks really like skew binary numbers for some reason. "Easy to increment and decrement!" they say. Your task is to write a program to convert decimal integers to skew binary in the format they like. This will help in making banners and other party material.

<br>Number representations are made up of a list of digits. Call the lowest order digit the rank 0 digit, the next, rank 1, etc. For example, in decimal representation, digits are 0-9,  the rank 0 digit has weight 1, the rank 1 digit has weight 10, and the rank i digit has weight 10<sup>i</sup>. In binary representation, the digits are 0 and 1, and the rank i digit has weight 2<sup>i</sup>. In skew binary representation, the digits are 0, 1, and 2, and the rank i digit has weight 2<sup>i+1</sup> -1.
<br><pre>
<br>Rank  	Weight 
<br>0	1 
<br>1  	3 
<br>2  	7 
<br>3  	15 
<br>4  	31 
<br>5  	63 
<br>6  	127 
<br>7  	255

<br>Allowing the digit 2 in the skew binary means there may be several ways to represent a given number. However the convention is that the digit 2 may only appear as the lowest rank non-zero digit. This makes the representation unique.
<br>
<br>In this problem, you should use a special way to write skew binary numbers as a list of ranks of non-zero digits in the number. The digit 2 is represented by the rank of the digit appearing twice in the list. Note that this means that only the first two ranks in the list may be equal. 
<br>
<br>Each rank is a decimal integer, and is separated from the next rank by a comma (','). A list is started by a '[' and ended by a ']'. For example, the decimal number 5, which has the skew representation 12, should be written as [0,0,1]. Decimal 0 is an empty list: []. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing a single decimal number with no leading or trailing white space.
