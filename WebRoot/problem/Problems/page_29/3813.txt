</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In one of his notebooks, Euclid gave a complex procedure for solving the following problem. With computers, perhaps there is an easier way.
<br>
<br>In a 2D plane, consider a line segment AB, another point C which is not collinear with AB, and a triangle DEF. The goal is to find points G and H such that:
<br>
<br>H is on the ray AC (it may be closer to A than C or further away, but angle CAB is the same as angle HAB)
<br>ABGH is a parallelogram (AB is parallel to HG, AH is parallel to BG)
<br>The area of parallelogram ABGH is the same as the area of triangle DEF
<br>

<br><p style="padding-left: 30px">
<br>AX AY BX BY CX CY DX DY EX EY FX FY
<br></p>
<br>where point A is (AX,AY), point B is (BX,BY), and so on. Points A, B and C are guaranteed to NOT be collinear. Likewise, D, E and F are also guaranteed to be non-collinear. Every number is guaranteed to be in the range from -1000.0 to 1000.0 inclusive. End of the input will be signified by a line with twelve 0.0's.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, print a single line with four decimal numbers. These represent points G and H, like this:
<br><p style="padding-left: 30px">
<br>GX GY HX HY
<br></p>
<br>where point G is (GX,GY) and point H is (HX,HY). Print all values rounded to 3 decimal places of precision (NOT truncated). Print a single space between numbers. Do not print any blank lines between answers.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">0 0 5 0 0 5 3 2 7 2 0 4
