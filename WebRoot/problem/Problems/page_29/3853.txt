The first line of each test case contains two integers m and n, the size of the board (0< m, n <100). Following the first line, there are m lines with n integers denoting the color in each cell. All the colors are positive integer numbers less than 10000. The input is terminated with a single line containing two consecutive zeros.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, write a single line containing the order of colors used to paint the board.
