</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Bob is a skilled system engineer. He is always facing challenging problems, and now he must solve a new one. He has to handle a set of servers with differing capabilities available to process job requests from persistent sources - jobs that need to be processed over a long or indefinite period of time. A sequence of persistent job requests arrives revealing a subset of servers capable of servicing their request. A job is processed on a single server and a server processes only one job. Bob has to schedule the maximum number of jobs on the servers. For example, if there are 2 jobs j1, j2 and 2 servers s1, s2, job j1 requiring the server s1, and job j2 requiring also the server s1. In this case Bob can schedule only one job. Can you help him? 
<br>In the general case there are n jobs numbered from 0 to n-1, n servers numbered from n to 2*n-1, and a sequence of job requests. The problem asks to find the maximum number of jobs that can be processed.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The program input is at most 1 MB. Each data set in the file stands for a particular set of jobs. A data set starts with the number n (n &lt;= 10000) of jobs, followed by the list of required servers for each job, in the format: <i>job<sub>number</sub>: (nr_servers) s<sub>1</sub> ... s<sub>nr_servers</sub></i> The program prints the maximum number of jobs that can be processed. 
<br>White spaces can occur freely in the input. The input data are correct and terminate with an end of file.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each set of data the program prints the result to the standard output from the beginning of a line.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2

The sequence of requests for job 0 is: 0: (1) 2, meaning that job 0 requires 1 sever, the server numbered 2. The sequence of requests for job 1 is: 1: (1) 2, meaning that job 1 requires 1 sever, the server numbered 2. The result for the data set is the length of the maximum number of scheduled jobs, 1. </div><p class="pst">
