</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">One may define a map of strings over an alphabet Σ<sub>B</sub> = { C1, C2, . . . C<sub>B</sub> } of size B to non-negative integer numbers, using characters as digits C1 = 0, C2 = 1, . . . , C<sub>B</sub> = B - 1 and interpreting the string as the representation of some number in a scale of notation with base B. Let us denote this map by U<sub>B</sub> , for a string α[ 1...n ] of length n we put
<br><center><font size=5>U<sub>B</sub>(α)=Σ<sub>0<=i<=n-1</sub>α[n-i]*B<sup>i</sup></font></center>
<br>For example, U3(1001) = 1*27 + 0*9 + 0*3 + 1*1 = 28.
<br>
<br>However, this correspondence has one major drawback: it is not ont-to-one. For example,
<br>28 = U3(1001) = U3(01001) = U3(001001) = ... ,
<br>infinitely many strings map to the number 28.
<br>
<br>In mathematical logic and computer science this may be unacceptable. To overcome this problem, the alternative interpretation is used. Let us interpret characters as digits, but in a slightly different way: C1 = 1, C2 = 2, . . . , C<sub>B</sub> = B . Note that now we do not have 0 digit, but rather we have a rudiment B digit. Now we define the map V<sub>B</sub> in a similar way, for each string α[ 1...n ] of length n we put
<br><center><font size=5>V<sub>B</sub>(α)=Σ<sub>0<=i<=n-1</sub>α[n-i]*B<sup>i</sup></font></center>
<br>For an empty string ε we put V<sub>B</sub>(ε) = 0.
<br>
<br>This map looks very much like U<sub>B</sub> , however, the set of digits is now different. So, for example, we have V3(1313) = 1*27 + 3*9 + 1*3 + 3*1 = 60. 
<br>
<br>It can be easily proved that the correspondence defined by this map is one-to-one and onto. Such a map is called bijective, and it is well known that every bijective map has an inverse. Your task in this problem is to compute the inverse for the map V<sub>B</sub> . That is, for a given integer number x you have to find the string α, such that V<sub>B</sub>(α) = x.
