</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">George likes arithmetics very much. Especially he likes the natural numbers series. His most favourite thing is the infinite sequence of digits, which results as the concatenation of all natural numbers in ascending order. The beginning of this sequence is 1234567891011121314... Let us call this sequence S. Then S[1] = 1, S[2] = 2, ..., S[10] = 1, S[11] = 0, ... , and so on.
<br>George takes a sequence of digits A and wants to know when it first appears in S. Help him to solve this difficult problem.
