</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A palindrome is a string of symbols that is equal to itself when reversed. Given an input string, not necessarily a palindrome, compute the number of swaps necessary to transform the string into a palindrome. By swap we mean reversing the order of two adjacent symbols. For example, the string "mamad" may be transformed into the palindrome "madam" with 3 swaps: 
<br>swap "ad" to yield "mamda" 
<br>swap "md" to yield "madma" 
<br>swap "ma" to yield "madam" 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input gives n, the number of test cases. For each test case, one line of input follows, containing a string of up to 8000 lowercase letters.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output consists of one line per test case. This line will contain the number of swaps, or "Impossible" if it is not possible to transform the input to a palindrome.
