</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Transmitting and memorizing information is a task that requires different coding systems for the best use of the available space. A well known system is that one where a number is associated to a character sequence. It is considered that the words are made only of small characters of the English alphabet a,b,c, ..., z (26 characters). From all these words we consider only those whose letters are in lexigraphical order (each character is smaller than the next character).
<br>
<br>The coding system works like this: 
<br>•	The words are arranged in the increasing order of their length.
<br>•	The words with the same length are arranged in lexicographical order (the order from the dictionary). 
<br>•	We codify these words by their numbering, starting with a, as follows:
<br>a 	- 1   
<br>b 	- 2
<br>...
<br>z 	- 26
<br>ab 	- 27
<br>...
<br>az 	- 51
<br>bc 	- 52
<br>...
<br>vwxyz 	- 83681
<br>...
<br>
<br>Specify for a given word if it can be codified according to this coding system. For the affirmative case specify its code.
