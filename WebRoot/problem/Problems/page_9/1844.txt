</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Consider the natural numbers from 1 to N. By associating to each number a sign (+ or -) and calculating the value of this expression we obtain a sum S. The problem is to determine for a given sum S the minimum number N for which we can obtain S by associating signs for all numbers between 1 to N.

<br>For a given S, find out the minimum value N in order to obtain S according to the conditions of the problem.
