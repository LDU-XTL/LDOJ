</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">All the tennis players are ordered by their results in an ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) classification. The past year's statistics say that in a game, if the difference between the two opponents is more than k places in the ATP top, then the player with the better classification will win for sure; but if the difference between the players is of k places or less, then the winner is uncertain.
