</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The National Resource Company (NRC) plans to use satellite to help identify potential mines. To make the problem clear, NRC assumes that the region of interest is a square of land, which can be coordinated as [0, N]*[0, N]. Potential mines are represented as various points in the square. Due to some technical hindrance, the satellite could only detect a region of square of M*M during a single trial, which will give the details of these potential mines within this detecting region. To further simplify the case, NRC announces that its satellite can only detect a region of square, whose vertex locates at the position of integer coordinates, i.e., [A, M+A]*[B, M+B](A and B are integers, and A>=0, B>=0, M+A<=N, M+B<=N); moreover, all the potential mines would never holds an integer coordinate. Therefore, a program should be provided which can determine the detecting region of the satellite to maximize the number of potential mines within the detecting square.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 <= T <= 20). Then follow T test cases. For each test case, the total number of points K (0 < K <=10000), N (0 < N <= 1000), M (0 < M <= 100, M <= N) are given in the first line; and the following K lines give the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the K potential mines. (Notice that the coordinates will be floats)</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, give the optimizing detecting region as print the coordinates of the lower-left vertex of the square in a single line. If more than one choice is possible, give the one that is at the upper-most on the land; if even this cannot turns out a unique solution, give the one that is at the right-most on the land.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">1
