</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A pretty straight forward task, calculate the number of primes between 2 integers.
<br>
<br>Given 2 integers A ≤ B &lt; 10<sup>5</sup> what’s the number of primes in range from A to B inclusive.
<br>
<br>Note: A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 and is divisible by 1 and itself only. For N to be prime it is enough to test the divisibility of numbers less than or equal to square root of N.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">As many as 1000 lines, each line contains 2 integers A and B separated by a space.
