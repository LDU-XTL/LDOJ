</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">It's year 2250 people are still playing chess but a new kind of chess is here, check out the new chess rules:
<br>
<br>Cells are no more on a grid, rather on a graph. i.e. cells are not tiled together they are sparse and connected by bi-directed links, two cells are said to be adjacent/connected if there’s a link between them. Cells still have colors (Black and white) and a cell color may change within the game according to the movements of the chess pieces!!
<br>
<br>Black and white kings are the only pieces available. The game is no longer player vs. player game; it’s a 1 player game to deliver both kings to cells on the grid with total minimum cost. (Pretty much changes this is not the 2000s chess anymore!).
<br>
<br>Let ws and we represent the start and the end locations of the white king.
<br>Let bs and be represent the start and the end locations of the black king.
<br>
<br>Define wc as the base cost of moving white king alone in a turn.
<br>Define bc as the base cost of moving black king alone in a turn.
<br>Define cc as the base cost of moving both kings in a turn.
<br>
<br>As you may notice the word “base” before cost because costs may be multiplied by a factor before being added to the total cost (as you will see later).
<br>
<br>The game starts with each king on a separate cell (ws, bs) and the goal is that both kings arrive to their respective destination cells (we, be) with the minimum cost possible. Initially black king is standing on a black cell (bs) and white king is standing on a white cell (ws), all other cells are white.
<br>
<br>Each turn one of three possible actions could happen:
<br><ol>
<br><li>Black king moves to an adjacent cell, adding a cost of bc or a cost of 2*bc iff the destination cell is white.</li>
<br><li>White king moves to an adjacent cell, adding a cost of wc or a cost of 2*wc iff the destination cell is black.</li>
<br><li>Both black and white kings move – simultaneously < to adjacent cells, adding a cost of cc, which could be 2*cc if and only if ONE king rests on a cell of different color (i.e. Either Black king moves to a white cell OR white king moves to a black cell), or 4*cc if BOTH kings rest on a cells of different colors than the kings them selves. (i.e. Black king moves to a white cell AND white king moves to a black cell)</li>
<br></ol>
<br>
<br>Moves are permitted as long as a king doesn’t move to the same position it’s already standing on and both kings are on 2 separate cells after the move is done.
<br>
<br>Note: When a king rests on a cell, the cell color is instantly changed to the king color, i.e. When a White king steps the cell instantly turns white and When a Black king steps the cell instantly turns black.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input starts with the number of test cases, t such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20
<br>
<br>Following t test cases formatted as follows:
<br>Number of cells in the chess graph, 2 ≤ N ≤ 11.
<br>
<br>Following N lines (each of length N) containing 0s and 1s only, representing the chess graph. (Cell i is connected to cell j iff the j’s character of the i’s string is ‘1’). Nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1.
<br>
<br>After that come White, black and combined costs 0 ≤ (wc, bc, cc) ≤ 100
<br>
<br>Then White start and end locations (ws, we).
<br>Then Black start and end locations (bs, be)
<br>
<br>There will be a blank line between each 2 test cases.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case a single line containing “Case #” then the case number, a colon, a space then the minimum cost to move white king from ws to we and black king from bs to be, or the word “Stalemate” if this is not achievable.
