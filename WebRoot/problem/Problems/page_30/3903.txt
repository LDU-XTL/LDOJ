</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The world financial crisis is quite a subject. Some people are more relaxed while others are quite anxious. John is one of them. He is very concerned about the evolution of the stock exchange. He follows stock prices every day looking for rising trends. Given a sequence of numbers p1, p2,...,pn representing stock prices, a rising trend is a subsequence pi1 &lt; pi2 &lt; ... &lt; pik, with i1 &lt; i2 &lt; ... &lt; ik. John’s problem is to find very quickly the longest rising trend.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each data set in the file stands for a particular set of stock prices. A data set starts with the length L (L ≤ 100000) of the sequence of numbers, followed by the numbers (a number fits a long integer).
