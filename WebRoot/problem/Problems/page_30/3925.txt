<br>Given a complete graph of n nodes with all nodes and edges weighted, your task is to find a tree, which is a sub-graph of the original graph, with m nodes and whose ratio is the smallest among all the trees of m nodes in the graph.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input contains multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2&lt;=n&lt;=15) and m (2&lt;=m&lt;=n), which stands for the number of nodes in the graph and the number of nodes in the minimal ratio tree. Two zeros end the input. The next line contains n numbers which stand for the weight of each node. The following n lines contain a diagonally symmetrical n√ón connectivity matrix with each element shows the weight of the edge connecting one node with another. Of course, the diagonal will be all 0, since there is no edge connecting a node with itself. 
<br> 
<br>All the weights of both nodes and edges (except for the ones on the diagonal of the matrix) are integers and in the range of [1, 100]. 
<br> 
<br>The figure below illustrates the first test case in sample input. Node 1 and Node 3 form the minimal ratio tree.

Nodes should be arranged in ascending order. If there are several such sequences, pick the one which has the smallest node number; if there's a tie, look at the second smallest node number, etc. Please note that the nodes are numbered from 1.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3 2
