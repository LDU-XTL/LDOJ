<br>
<br>game played with small, rectangular blocks of wood or other material, each identified by a number of dots, or pips, on its face. The blocks usually are called bones, dominoes, or pieces and sometimes men, stones, or even cards.
<br>
<br>The face of each piece is divided, by a line or ridge, into two squares, each of which is marked as would be a pair of dice...
<br>
<br>The principle in nearly all modern dominoes games is to match one end of a piece to another that is identically or reciprocally numbered.  
<br>ENCYCLOP&AElig;DIA BRITANNICA 
<br>Consider an arbitrary set of domino pieces where each piece is marked with two digits from 1 to 6. Some sets can be completely laid out in a row matching one end of a piece to another that is identically numbered, while others cannot. For example, the set consisting of 5 pieces: (1, 5), (1, 6), (5, 5) and (2, 4) twice, cannot be laid out in a row. However, if we add (2, 5) piece to the above set we could lay out the resulting set in the following row:

<br>However, we are interested in a row having the smallest sum of digits on its pieces. In our example, instead of the piece (2, 5) with a sum of 7, we could add two pieces (1, 2) with a total sum of 6 to lay out the following row:

<br>Your task is to write a program that for a given domino set will find an additional (possibly empty) set with the smallest possible sum of digits, so that a row could be laid out with both sets combined.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains a single integer N (2 <= N <= 100) representing the total number of pieces in the domino set. The following N lines describe pieces. Each piece is represented on a separate line in a form of two digits from 1 to 6 separated by a space. The digits of a piece can be written in any order.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">On the first line of the output file write the smallest sum of digits of the additional set or 0 if that set is empty. On the second line write the total number of pieces in the additional set or 0 if that set is empty. Then write the pieces of the additional set in the same format as in input.
<br>
<br>If there are a number of additional sets with the same smallest sum of digits exist then write any one of them.
