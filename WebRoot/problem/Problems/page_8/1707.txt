<br>for some fixed natural k and different natural n. He observed that calculating i<sup>k</sup> for all i (1<=i<=n) and summing up results is a too slow way to do it, because the number of required arithmetical operations increases as n increases. Fortunately, there is another method which takes only a constant number of operations regardless of n. It is possible to show that the sum S<sub>k</sub>(n) is equal to some polynomial of degree k+1 in the variable n with rational coefficients, i.e.,

<br>We require that integer M be positive and as small as possible. Under this condition the entire set of such numbers (i.e. M, a<SUB>k+1</SUB>, a<SUB>k</SUB>, ... , a<SUB>1</SUB>, a<SUB>0</SUB>) will be unique for the given k. You have to write a program to find such set of coefficients to help the schoolboy make his calculations quicker.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input file contains a single integer k (1<=k<=20). </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Write integer numbers M, a<SUB>k+1</SUB>, a<SUB>k</SUB>, ... ,  a<SUB>1</SUB>, a<SUB>0</SUB> to the output file in the given order.
