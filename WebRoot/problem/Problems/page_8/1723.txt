</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">N soldiers of the land Gridland are randomly scattered around the country. 
<br>A position in Gridland is given by a pair (x,y) of integer coordinates. Soldiers can move - in one move, one soldier can go one unit up, down, left or right (hence, he can change either his x or his y coordinate by 1 or -1). 
<br>
<br>The soldiers want to get into a horizontal line next to each other (so that their final positions are (x,y), (x+1,y), ..., (x+N-1,y), for some x and y). Integers x and y, as well as the final order of soldiers along the horizontal line is arbitrary. 
<br>
<br>The goal is to minimise the total number of moves of all the soldiers that takes them into such configuration. 
<br>
<br>Two or more soldiers must never occupy the same position at the same time. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input contains the integer N, 1 <= N <= 10000, the number of soldiers. 
<br>The following N lines of the input contain initial positions of the soldiers : for each i, 1 <= i <= N, the (i+1)<sup>st</sup> line of the input file contains a pair of integers x[i] and y[i] separated by a single blank character, representing the coordinates of the ith soldier, -10000 <= x[i],y[i] <= 10000.
