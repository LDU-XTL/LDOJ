</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Triathlon is an athletic contest consisting of three consecutive sections that should be completed as fast as possible as a whole. The first section is swimming, the second section is riding bicycle and the third one is running.
<br>
<br>The speed of each contestant in all three sections is known. The judge can choose the length of each section arbitrarily provided that no section has zero length. As a result sometimes she could choose their lengths in such a way that some particular contestant would win the competition.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains integer number N (1 <= N <= 100), denoting the number of contestants. Then N lines follow, each line contains three integers Vi, Ui and Wi (1 <= Vi, Ui, Wi <= 10000), separated by spaces, denoting the speed of ith contestant in each section.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For every contestant write to the output file one line, that contains word "Yes" if the judge could choose the lengths of the sections in such a way that this particular contestant would win (i.e. she is the only one who would come first), or word "No" if this is impossible.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">9
