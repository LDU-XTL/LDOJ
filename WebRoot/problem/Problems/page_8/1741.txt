</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Give a tree with n vertices,each edge has a length(positive integer less than 1001).
<br>Define dist(u,v)=The min distance between node u and v.
<br>Give an integer k,for every pair (u,v) of vertices is called valid if and only if dist(u,v) not exceed k.
<br>Write a program that will count how many pairs which are valid for a given tree. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k. (n<=10000) The following n-1 lines each contains three integers u,v,l, which means there is an edge between node u and v of length l.
<br>The last test case is followed by two zeros.
