</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><img src=images/1728_1.jpg align=right>An infinite chessboard is obtained by extending a finite chessboard to the right and up infinitely. Each square of the chessboard is either black or white with the side of S milimiters, 0 < S <= 1000. The leftmost bottom square of the chessboard is black. A flea is positioned on the chessboard at the point (x, y) (given in milimeters) and makes jumps by jumping dx milimeters to the right and dy milimiters up, 0 < dx, dy, that is, a flea at position (x, y) after one jump lands at position (x+dx, y+dy). 
<br>Given the starting position of the flea on the board your task is to find out after how many jumps the flea will reach a white square. If the flea lands on a boundary between two squares then it does not count as landing on the white square. Note that it is possible that the flea never reaches a white square.
