</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">People in Silverland use coins.They have coins of value A1,A2,A3...An Silverland dollar.One day Tony opened his money-box and found there were some coins.He decided to buy a very nice watch in a nearby shop. He wanted to pay the exact price(without change) and he known the price would not more than m.But he didn't know the exact price of the watch.
<br>You are to write a program which reads n,m,A1,A2,A3...An and C1,C2,C3...Cn corresponding to the number of Tony's coins of value A1,A2,A3...An then calculate how many prices(form 1 to m) Tony can pay use these coins.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n(1<=n<=100),m(m<=100000).The second line contains 2n integers, denoting A1,A2,A3...An,C1,C2,C3...Cn (1<=Ai<=100000,1<=Ci<=1000). The last test case is followed by two zeros.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case output the answer on a single line.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3 10
