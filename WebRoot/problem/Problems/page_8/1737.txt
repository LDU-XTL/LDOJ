</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">An undirected graph is a set V of vertices and a set of Eâˆˆ{V*V} edges.An undirected graph is connected if and only if for every pair (u,v) of vertices,u is reachable from v.
<br>You are to write a program that tries to calculate the number of different connected undirected graph with n vertices.
<br>For example,there are 4 different connected undirected graphs with 3 vertices.
