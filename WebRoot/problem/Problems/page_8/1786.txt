</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Drivers of Advanced Cargo Movement, Ltd. usually have to wait quite a long time when waiting at border crossings for duty clearance. They are used to play various (card) games to have some fun. One of the games is Bridge. Playing Bridge involves dealing a standard deck of 52 cards to 4 players, so that each player receives 13 cards. Good players can then play with the hand as it is dealt, but most ordinary players will need to sort it, firstly by suit and then by rank within suit. There is no fixed ranking of the suits for this purpose, but it is useful to alternate the colors, so we will presume the following ordering:  (club) <  (diamond) <  (spade) <  (heart). (Note that because most character sets do not recognize these symbols, from now on we will use the more conventional C, D, S, and H). Within a suit, Ace is high, so the ordering is 
<br>2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < T < J < Q < K < A . 
<br>The players are usually called North, South, East, and West as they sit at the points of the compass. One player is designated the dealer and she deals one card to each player starting with the player on her left and proceeding clockwise until she deals the last card to herself. 
<br>
<br>Write a program that will read in a representation of a deck of cards, deal them, sort them, and then display four sorted hands in the format shown below. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of a series of deals.

The file is be terminated by a line consisting of a single hash character ("#"). </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output should consist of a series of sets of 24 lines, one set for each deal, separated by blank lines.
