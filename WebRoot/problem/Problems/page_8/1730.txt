</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><img src=images/1730_1.jpg align=right>We say that x is a perfect square if, for some integer b, x = b<sup>2</sup>. Similarly, x is a perfect cube if, for some integer b, x = b<sup>3</sup>. More generally, x is a perfect pth power if, for some integer b, x = b<sup>p</sup>. Given an integer x you are to determine the largest p such that x is a perfect p<i>th</i> power. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each test case is given by a line of input containing x. The value of x will have magnitude at least 2 and be within the range of a (32-bit) int in C, C++, and Java.
