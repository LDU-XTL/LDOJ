</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Alice and Bob decide to play a new stone game.At the beginning of the game they pick n(1<=n<=10) piles of stones in a line. Alice and Bob move the stones in turn.
<br>At each step of the game,the player choose a pile,remove at least one stones,then freely move stones from this pile to any other pile that still has stones.
<br>For example:n=4 and the piles have (3,1,4,2) stones.If the player chose the first pile and remove one.Then it can reach the follow states. 
<br> 2 1 4 2
<br> 1 2 4 2（move one stone to Pile 2）
<br> 1 1 5 2（move one stone to Pile 3）
<br> 1 1 4 3（move one stone to Pile 4）
<br> 0 2 5 2（move one stone to Pile 2 and another one to Pile 3）
<br> 0 2 4 3（move one stone to Pile 2 and another one to Pile 4）
<br> 0 1 5 3（move one stone to Pile 3 and another one to Pile 4）
<br> 0 3 4 2（move two stones to Pile 2）
<br> 0 1 6 2（move two stones to Pile 3）
<br> 0 1 4 4（move two stones to Pile 4）
<br>Alice always moves first. Suppose that both Alice and Bob do their best in the game.
<br>You are to write a program to determine who will finally win the game. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer number n, denoting the number of piles. The following n integers describe the number of stones in each pile at the beginning of the game, you may assume the number of stones in each pile will not exceed 100.
<br>The last test case is followed by one zero.
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, if Alice win the game,output 1,otherwise output 0.
