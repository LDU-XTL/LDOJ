</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><img src=images/1759_1.jpg align=right>The New Year garland consists of N lamps attached to a common wire that hangs down on the ends to which outermost lamps are affixed. The wire sags under the weight of lamp in a particular way: each lamp is hanging at the height that is 1 millimeter lower than the average height of the two adjacent lamps.
<br>
<br>The leftmost lamp in hanging at the height of A millimeters above the ground. You have to determine the lowest height B of the rightmost lamp so that no lamp in the garland lies on the ground though some of them may touch the ground.
<br>
<br>You shall neglect the lamp's size in this problem. By numbering the lamps with integers from 1 to N and denoting the ith lamp height in millimeters as Hi we derive the following equations:
<br>
<br>H1 = A 
<br>Hi = (H<sub>i-1</sub> + H<sub>i+1</sub>)/2 - 1, for all 1 < i < N 
<br>HN = B 
<br>Hi >= 0, for all 1 <= i <= N 
<br>
<br>The sample garland with 8 lamps that is shown on the picture has A = 15 and B = 9.75.
