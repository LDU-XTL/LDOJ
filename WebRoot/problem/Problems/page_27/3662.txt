</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>Farmer John wants to set up a telephone line at his farm. Unfortunately, the phone company is uncooperative, so he needs to pay for some of the cables required to connect his farm to the phone system.</p><p>There are <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 1,000) forlorn telephone poles conveniently numbered 1..<i>N</i> that are scattered around Farmer John's property; no cables connect any them. A total of <i>P</i> (1 &le; <i>P</i> &le; 10,000) pairs of poles can be connected by a cable; the rest are too far apart.</p><p>The <i>i</i>-th cable can connect the two distinct poles <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>i</sub></i>, with length <i>L<sub>i</sub></i> (1 &le; <i>L<sub>i</sub></i> &le; 1,000,000) units if used. The input data set never names any {<i>A<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>i</sub></i>} pair more than once. Pole 1 is already connected to the phone system, and pole<i> N</i> is at the farm. Poles 1 and <i>N </i>need to be connected by a path of cables; the rest of the poles might be used or might not be used.</p><p>As it turns out, the phone company is willing to provide Farmer John with <i>K</i> (0 &le; <i>K</i> &lt; <i>N</i>) lengths of cable for free. Beyond that he will have to pay a price equal to the length of the longest remaining cable he requires (each pair of poles is connected with a separate cable), or 0 if he does not need any additional cables.</p><p>Determine the minimum amount that Farmer John must pay.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: <i>N</i>, <i>P</i>, and <i>K</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>P</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 contains the three space-separated integers: <i>A<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>i</sub></i>, and <i>L<sub>i</sub></i> </p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: A single integer, the minimum amount Farmer John can pay.
