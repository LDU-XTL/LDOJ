</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Every September, the Kingdom of Loowater holds a jousting tournament. In each of a series of event, a pair of knights attempt to knock each other from their respective horses. The winning knight is paired with another, while the loser is elimnated. This process continues until all but one knight is eliminated; this knight is declared champion. </p><p>The tournament schedule is organized so that no knight needs to compete in more than <i>e</i> events to be champion, for the minimum possible <i>e</i> given <i>k</i>, the number of knights. In order to construct the schedule, it may be necessary to identify several knights who compete in fewer than <i>e</i> events; these knights are said to be awarded a bye and are excluded from the first round of competition. </p><p>The first round of competition involves pairing as many knights as possible among those who are not awarded a bye. The competition is more interesting if the knights in each pair are as evenly matched in ability as possible. You are to determine which knights should be awarded a bye so as to make the first round as interesting as possible. </p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Standard input consists of several test cases followed by a line containing 0.
