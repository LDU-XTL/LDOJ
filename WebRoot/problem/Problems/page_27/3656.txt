</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>As a member of the International Rock-Skipping League, you travel to a different lake each week and compete in a rock-skipping contest. The goal is to throw a rock so that it skips as many times as possible; the exact rules for determining the winner are given below. To make the competitions interesting, the IRSL often chooses lakes with logs, sandbars, and other obstacles. You are provided with a side-view, water-level "map" of the lake as shown in the top line of the example below. (The numbers 0..29 below the map are just for reference.) A period (".") indicates clear water, where a rock will skip; any other character indicates some kind of obstacle that will stop a rock.</p><blockquote><tt>...=...**..#...@....:.:.:..=..</tt><br><tt>______________________________</tt><br><tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11111111112222222222</tt><br><tt>012345678901234567890123456789</tt> </blockquote><p>You stand at the left end of the lake. You can throw a rock so that it lands at any position in the lake, and then skips at any fixed interval thereafter. So a throw can be defined as a pair (<i>i</i>,<i>d</i>), where <i>i</i> &#8805; 0 is the initial landing position and <i>d</i> &gt; 0 is the distance between skips. Note that <i>d</i> must be positive. The <dfn>count</dfn> of a throw is the number of times that it skips on the water. The <dfn>length</dfn> is the position of its last contact with either the water or an obstacle. To rank two distinct throws, use the following criteria, in order, until a winner is determined: count (highest wins); length (greatest wins); initial position (greatest wins); distance between skips (smallest wins).</p><p>For the map shown above, throw (27,2) hits the obstacle at position 27; it has count 0 and length 27. Throw (16,1) skips at positions 16, 17, 18, and 19, then hits the obstacle at position 20; it has count 4 and length 20, so it beats throw (27,2). Throw (2,7) skips at positions 2, 9, 16, and 23, then skips over the lake; it has count 4 and length 23, so it beats throw (16,1). Throw (1,4) skips at positions 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, and 29, then skips over the lake; it has count 8 and distance 29, and is the best possible throw for this lake.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of one or more lake maps, each 1&#8211;40 characters long and on a line by itself, followed by a line containing only "END" that signals the end of the input.
