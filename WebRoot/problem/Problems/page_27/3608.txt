</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Thousands of thousands years ago there was a small kingdom located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The territory of the kingdom consists two separated islands. Due to the impact of the ocean current, the shapes of both the islands became convex polygons. The king of the kingdom wanted to establish a bridge to connect the two islands. To minimize the cost, the king asked you, the bishop, to find the minimal distance between the boundaries of the two islands. </p><img src="images/3608_1.gif" /></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of several test cases.<br>Each test case begins with two integers <i>N</i>, <i>M</i>.
