</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>The oppressively hot summer days have raised the cows' clamoring to its highest level. Farmer John has finally decided to build an artificial lake. For his engineering studies, he is modeling the lake as a two-dimensional landscape consisting of a contiguous sequence of <i>N</i> soon-to-be-submerged levels (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100,000) conveniently numbered 1..<i>N</i> from left to right.</p><p>Each level <i>i</i> is described by two integers, its width <i>W<sub>i</sub></i> (1 &le; <i>W<sub>i</sub></i> &le; 1,000) and height (like a relative elevation) <i>H<sub>i</sub></i> (1 &le; <i>H<sub>i</sub></i> &le; 1,000,000). The heights of FJ's levels are unique. An infinitely tall barrier encloses the lake's model on the left and right. One example lake profile is shown below.</p><pre>

The water falls directly downward until it hits something, and then it flows and spreads as room-temperature water always does. As in all good models, assume that falling and flowing happen instantly. Determine the time at which each elevation's becomes submerged by a single unit of water.</p><pre>
