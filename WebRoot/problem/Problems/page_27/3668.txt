Bessie would like to know her chances of winning, so she has asked you to help find the maximum score she can obtain.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: A single integer: <i>N</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>N</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 describes lattice point <i>i</i> with two space-separated integers: <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>Y<sub>i</sub></i>.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: A single integer representing the maximal number of lines Bessie can draw, no two of which are parallel.<br>ã€€</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">4
