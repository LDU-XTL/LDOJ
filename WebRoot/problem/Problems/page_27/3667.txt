Bessie, ever the competent travel agent, has named the Bullmoose Hotel on famed Cumberland Street as their vacation residence. This immense hotel has <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 50,000) rooms all located on the same side of an extremely long hallway (all the better to see the lake, of course).</p><p>The cows and other visitors arrive in groups of size <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> (1 &le; <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> &le; N) and approach the front desk to check in. Each group <i>i</i> requests a set of <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> contiguous rooms from Canmuu, the moose staffing the counter. He assigns them some set of consecutive room numbers <i>r</i>..<i>r</i>+<i>D<sub>i</sub></i>-1 if they are available or, if no contiguous set of rooms is available, politely suggests alternate lodging. Canmuu always chooses the value of <i>r</i> to be the smallest possible.</p><p>Visitors also depart the hotel from groups of contiguous rooms. Checkout <i>i</i> has the parameters<i> X<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> which specify the vacating of rooms <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> ..<i>X<sub>i</sub></i> +<i>D<sub>i</sub></i>-1 (1 &le; <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> &le; <i>N</i>-<i>D<sub>i</sub></i>+1). Some (or all) of those rooms might be empty before the checkout.</p><p>Your job is to assist Canmuu by processing <i>M</i> (1 &le; <i>M</i> &lt; 50,000) checkin/checkout requests. The hotel is initially unoccupied.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>N</i> and <i>M</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>M</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 contains request expressed as one of two possible formats: (a) Two space separated integers representing a check-in request: 1 and <i>D<sub>i </sub></i>(b) Three space-separated integers representing a check-out: 2, <i>X<sub>i</sub></i>, and <i>D<sub>i </sub></i></p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Lines 1.....: For each check-in request, output a single line with a single integer <i>r</i>, the first room in the contiguous sequence of rooms to be occupied.
