</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>Professor Ben is an old stubborn man teaching mathematics in a university. He likes to puzzle his students with perplexing (sometimes boring) problems. Today his task is: for a given integer <i>N</i>, <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, ... ,<i>a<sub>n</sub></i> are the factors of <i>N</i>, let <i>b<sub>i</sub></i> be the number of factors of <i>a</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, your job is to find the sum of cubes of all <i>b<sub>i</sub></i>. Looking at the confused faces of his students, Prof. Ben explains it with a satisfied smile:</p><p>Let&#39;s assume <i>N</i> = 4. Then it has three factors 1, 2, and 4. Their numbers of factors are 1, 2 and 3 respectively. So the sum is 1 plus 8 plus 27 which equals 36. So 36 is the answer for <i>N</i> = 4.</p><p>Given an integer <i>N</i>, your task is to find the answer.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line contains the number the test cases, <i>Q</i>(1 ≤ <i>Q</i> ≤ 500000).
