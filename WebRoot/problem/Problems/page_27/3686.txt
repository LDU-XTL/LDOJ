The manager knows that every order will take different amount of hours in different workshops. More precisely, the <i>i</i>-th order will take <i>Z<sub>ij</sub></i> hours if the toys are making in the <i>j</i>-th workshop. Moreover, each order's work must be wholly completed in the same workshop. And a workshop can not switch to another order until it has finished the&nbsp;previous one. The switch does not cost any time.</p><p>The manager wants to minimize the average of the finishing time of the <i>N</i> orders.
