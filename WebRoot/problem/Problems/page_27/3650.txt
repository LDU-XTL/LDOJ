Certain characters are reserved within URIs, and if a reserved character is part of an identifier then it must be <dfn>percent-encoded</dfn> by replacing it with a percent sign followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character. A table of seven reserved characters and their encodings is shown below. Your job is to write a program that can percent-encode a string of characters.</p><table align="center"><thead><tr><td><b>Character</b></td><td><b>Encoding</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>" " (space)</td><td align="right">%20</td></tr><tr><td>"<tt>!</tt>" (exclamation point)</td><td align="right">%21</td></tr><tr><td>"<tt>$</tt>" (dollar sign)</td><td align="right">%24</td></tr><tr><td>"<tt>%</tt>" (percent sign)</td><td align="right">%25</td></tr><tr><td>"<tt>(</tt>" (left parenthesis)</td><td align="right">%28</td></tr><tr><td>"<tt>)</tt>" (right parenthesis)</td><td align="right">%29</td></tr><tr><td>"<tt>*</tt>" (asterisk)</td><td align="right">%2a</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of one or more strings, each 1&#8211;79 characters long and on a line by itself, followed by a line containing only "#" that signals the end of the input.

A string may contain spaces, but not at the beginning or end of the string, and there will never be two or more consecutive spaces.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each input string, replace every occurrence of a reserved character in the table above by its percent-encoding, exactly as shown, and output the resulting string on a line by itself.
