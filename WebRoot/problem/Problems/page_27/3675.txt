</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Updog is watching a plane object with a telescope. The field of vision in the telescope can be described as a circle. The center is at the origin and the radius is <i>R</i>. The object can be seen as a simple polygon of <i>N</i> vertexes. Updog wants to know the area of the part of the object that can be seen in the telescope.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input will contain several test cases. For each case:<br>The first line contains only one real number <i>R</i>. <br>The second line contains an integer <i>N</i>. The following <i>N</i> lines contain two real numbers <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>i</sub></i> each, which describe the coordinates of a vertex.
