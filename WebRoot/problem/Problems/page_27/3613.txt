</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>For their physical fitness program, <i>N</i> (2 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 1,000,000) cows have decided to run a relay race using the <i>T</i> (2 &le; <i>T</i> &le; 100) cow trails throughout the pasture.</p><p>Each trail connects two different intersections (1 &le; <i>I</i><sub>1<i>i</i></sub> &le; 1,000; 1 &le; <i>I</i><sub>2<i>i</i></sub> &le; 1,000), each of which is the termination for at least two trails. The cows know the <i>length<sub>i</sub></i> of each trail (1 &le; <i>length<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp; &le; 1,000), the two intersections the trail connects, and they know that no two intersections are directly connected by two different trails. The trails form a structure known mathematically as a graph.</p><p>To run the relay, the <i>N</i> cows position themselves at various intersections (some intersections might have more than one cow). They must position themselves properly so that they can hand off the baton cow-by-cow and end up at the proper finishing place.</p><p>Write a program to help position the cows. Find the shortest path that connects the starting intersection (<i>S</i>) and the ending intersection (<i>E</i>) and traverses exactly <i>N</i> cow trails.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: Four space-separated integers: <i>N</i>, <i>T</i>, <i>S</i>, and <i>E</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>T</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 describes trail <i>i</i> with three space-separated integers: <i>length<sub>i</sub></i> , <i>I</i><sub>1<i>i</i></sub> , and <i>I</i><sub>2<i>i</i></sub> </p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: A single integer that is the shortest distance from intersection <i>S</i> to intersection <i>E</i> that traverses exactly <i>N</i> cow trails.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2 6 6 4
