</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>Farmer John's cows are getting restless about their poor telephone service; they want FJ to replace the old telephone wire with new, more efficient wire. The new wiring will utilize <i>N</i> (2 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100,000) already-installed telephone poles, each with some <i>height<sub>i</sub></i> meters (1 &le; <i>height<sub>i</sub></i> &le; 100). The new wire will connect the tops of each pair of adjacent poles and will incur a penalty cost <i>C</i> &times; the two poles' height difference for each section of wire where the poles are of different heights (1 &le; <i>C</i> &le; 100). The poles, of course, are in a certain sequence and can not be moved.</p><p>Farmer John figures that if he makes some poles taller he can reduce his penalties, though with some other additional cost. He can add an integer <i>X</i> number of meters to a pole at a cost of <i>X</i><sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Help Farmer John determine the cheapest combination of growing pole heights and connecting wire so that the cows can get their new and improved service.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>N</i> and <i>C</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>N</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 contains a single integer: <i>height<sub>i</sub></i> </p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>* Line 1: The minimum total amount of money that it will cost Farmer John to attach the new telephone wire.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">5 2
