Every card has a number <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> on it. Alice and Bob takes turns to draw a card from the box. Of course, they will not know the number until they draw the card out of the box. The player then takes away <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> stones from the pile if it is possible. If there are not enough stones, the player draws a card again. The winner is the player who takes away the last stone. Once the box gets empty, they brings back all cards and stones and play the game again until there is a winner.</p><p>Now your best friend Alice begs you, the judge, to help her cheat in the game. You have already known the number of cards in the box and their numbers.
