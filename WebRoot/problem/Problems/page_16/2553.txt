</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">We will use the following (standard) definitions from graph theory. Let <i>V</i> be a nonempty and finite set, its elements being called vertices (or nodes). Let <i>E</i> be a subset of the Cartesian product <i>V&times;V</i>, its elements being called edges. Then <i>G=(V,E)</i> is called a directed graph.
<br>Let <i>n</i> be a positive integer, and let <i>p=(e<sub>1</sub>,...,e<sub>n</sub>)</i> be a sequence of length <i>n</i> of edges <i>e<sub>i</sub>&isin;E</i> such that <i>e<sub>i</sub>=(v<sub>i</sub>,v<sub>i+1</sub>)</i> for a sequence of vertices <i>(v<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>n+1</sub>)</i>. Then <i>p</i> is called a path from vertex <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> to vertex <i>v<sub>n+1</sub></i> in <i>G</i> and we say that <i>v<sub>n+1</sub></i> is reachable from <i>v<sub>1</sub></i>, writing <i>(v<sub>1</sub>&rarr;v<sub>n+1</sub>)</i>.
<br>Here are some new definitions. A node <i>v</i> in a graph <i>G=(V,E)</i> is called a sink, if for every node <i>w</i> in <i>G</i> that is reachable from <i>v</i>, <i>v</i> is also reachable from <i>w</i>. The bottom of a graph is the subset of all nodes that are sinks, i.e., <i>bottom(G)={v&isin;V|&forall;w&isin;V:(v&rarr;w)&rArr;(w&rarr;v)}</i>. You have to calculate the bottom of certain graphs.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several test cases, each of which corresponds to a directed graph <i>G</i>. Each test case starts with an integer number <i>v</i>, denoting the number of vertices of <i>G=(V,E)</i>, where the vertices will be  identified by the integer numbers in the set <i>V={1,...,v}</i>. You may assume that <i>1&lt;=v&lt;=5000</i>. That is followed by a non-negative integer <i>e</i> and, thereafter, <i>e</i> pairs of vertex identifiers <i>v<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>e</sub>,w<sub>e</sub></i> with the meaning that <i> (v<sub>i</sub>,w<sub>i</sub>)&isin;E</i>. There are no edges other than specified by these pairs. The last test case is followed by a zero.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case output the bottom of the specified graph on a single line. To this end, print the numbers of all nodes that are sinks in sorted order separated by a single space character. If the bottom is empty, print an empty line. <img src=images/2553_1.jpg align=right></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3 3
