</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Signals of most probably extra-terrestrial origin have been received and digitalized by The Aeronautic and Space Administration (that must be going through a defiant phase: "But I want to use feet, not meters!"). Each signal seems to come in two parts: a sequence of n integer values and a non-negative integer t. We'll not go into details, but researchers found out that a signal encodes two integer values. These can be found as the lower and upper bound of a subrange of the sequence whose absolute value of its sum is closest to t. 
<br>
<br>You are given the sequence of n integers and the non-negative target t. You are to find a non-empty range of the sequence (i.e. a continuous subsequence) and output its lower index l and its upper index u. The absolute value of the sum of the values of the sequence from the l-th to the u-th element (inclusive) must be at least as close to t as the absolute value of the sum of any other non-empty range. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with two numbers n and k. Input is terminated by n=k=0. Otherwise, 1<=n<=100000 and there follow n integers with absolute values <=10000 which constitute the sequence. Then follow k queries for this sequence. Each query is a target t with 0<=t<=1000000000. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each query output 3 numbers on a line: some closest absolute sum and the lower and upper indices of some range where this absolute sum is achieved. Possible indices start with 1 and go up to n. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">5 1
