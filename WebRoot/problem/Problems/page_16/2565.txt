</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A relay is a race for two or more teams of runners. Each member of a team runs one section of the race. Your task is to help to evaluate the results of a relay race. 
<br>You have to process several teams. For each team you are given a list with the running times for every section of the race. You are to compute the average time per kilometer over the whole distance. That's easy, isn't it? 
<br>
<br>So if you like the fun and challenge competing at this contest, perhaps you like a relay race, too. Students from Ulm participated e.g. at the "SOLA" relay in Zurich, Switzerland. For more information visit http://www.sola.asvz.ethz.ch/ after the contest is over. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input specifies the number of sections n followed by the total distance of the relay d in kilometers. You may safely assume that 1<=n<=20 and 0.0 < d < 200.0. Every following line gives information about one team: the team number t (an integer, right-justified in a field of width 3) is followed by the n results for each section, separated by a single space. These running times are given in the format "h:mm:ss" with integer numbers for the hours, minutes and seconds, respectively. In the special case of a runner being disqualified, the running time will be denoted by "-:--:--". Finally, the data on every line is terminated by a newline character. Input is terminated by EOF. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each team output exactly one line giving the team's number t right aligned in a field of width 3, and the average time for this team rounded to whole seconds in the format "m:ss". If at least one of the team's runners has been disqualified, output "-" instead. Adhere to the sample output for the exact format of presentation. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2 12.5
