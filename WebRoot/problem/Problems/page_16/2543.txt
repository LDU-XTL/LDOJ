</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">You are to write a program emulating a very simple spreadsheet application. It works with a table with 9 rows, from "1" to "9", and 26 columns, from "A" to "Z". Table cells are referenced by names composed of column and row codes, ex. "B1", "S8".
<br>
<br>Each cell contains an expression up to 255 characters long. Expressions use integer constants, cell references, parenthesis, operators "+", "-", "*", and "/" (whole division). For example: 567, E8/2, (3+B3)*(C4-1) are all valid expressions. All operators are whole, all arguments and results are guaranteed to be less than 1000000. Division by zero yields zero.
<br>
<br>If the value of the cell referenced by some expression is not defined, it is presumed to be 0 (zero). The situation when two or more cells are mutually dependent on each other is considered a special case of "circular reference". </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">First input line contains number of expressions N. Following N lines are in format < Cell reference>=< expression>.
