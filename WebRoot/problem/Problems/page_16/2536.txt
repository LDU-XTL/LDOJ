<br>
<br>The are n gophers and m gopher holes, each at distinct (x, y) coordinates. A hawk arrives and if a gopher does not reach a hole in s seconds it is vulnerable to being eaten. A hole can save at most one gopher. All the gophers run at the same velocity v. The gopher family needs an escape strategy that minimizes the number of vulnerable gophers.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several cases. The first line of each case contains four positive integers less than 100: n, m, s, and v. The next n lines give the coordinates of the gophers; the following m lines give the coordinates of the gopher holes. All distances are in metres; all times are in seconds; all velocities are in metres per second. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output consists of a single line for each case, giving the number of vulnerable gophers.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2 2 5 10
