</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Read the statement of problem E: Edge to understand how to fold a sheet of paper and how to interpret the input. We define a "stripe" to be a maximally large part of the sheet that has no folding line going through. Since the turns occur at equidistant places, all stripes are congruent. 
<br>
<br>In this problem you are given the description of the result of performing several folding steps as in problem E: Edge, i.e., in the unfolded state. Additionally, you know that the length of the sheet in its folded state is exactly the length of 1 stripe (again, we ignore thickness). 
<br>
<br>Find the minimum number of folding steps necessary to generate the described sheet from an initially flat sheet of paper. Note that performing a folding step may create more than one turn in the result because parts of the sheet already overlay due to previous folding steps. When a step is carried out, however, all overlaying parts of the sheet are affected, i.e., it is not allowed to fold, say, only the top three layers. 
<br>
<br>Finally, note that every result can be obtained by iterating through the turns in a fixed direction and performing a folding step at each turn, thereby accumulating a 1 stripe long stack of all stripes. If n is the number of turns in the input description, this procedure in fact requires n folding steps, which is not necessarily minimal as can be observed in the sample output.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several test cases, each on a separate line. Each line contains a nonempty string of characters A and V describing the longer edge of the sheet. You may assume that the length of the string is less than 200. The input file terminates immediately after the last test case. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case print on a line the minimum number of folding steps required to produce the described sheet of paper.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">V
