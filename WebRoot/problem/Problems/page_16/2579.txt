</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Aliasing is the stair-step effect achieved when attempting to represent a smooth curve using a finite number of discrete pixels. Of course, all computer displays consist of a finite number of pixels, and many strategies have been devised to smooth the jagged edges with varying degrees of success. 
<br>
<br>Boudreaux and Thibodeaux are writing video game rendering software for the next big first-person shooter, and they don't know much about any of the progress made in the field of anti-aliasing. Therefore, they've decided to use a very simplistic (and visually unappealing) method to smooth the ragged edges. Unfortunately, it blurs the entire image, but at least it gets rid of those jaggies! 
<br>
<br>Normally, the game displays in m x n pixels, but they perform an extra anti-aliasing step that converts that image into an (m - 1) x (n - 1) image. Nobody will notice a pixel missing from each dimension, and they can calculate the new pixels by averaging squares of 4 pixels from the original image (and rounding down). For example, the images below represent the original image (left) and the anti-aliased image (right) using numbers to represent varying shades of black and white.

<br><li>Original Image - A series of R lines, each of which contains C integers from 0 to 9 inclusive. These integers represent the grayscale value of a pixel in the original image and will not be separated by spaces. 
<br><li>End line - A single line:
