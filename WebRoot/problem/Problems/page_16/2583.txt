</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Boudreaux and Thibodeaux aren't very good at math, so they need you to write a program that can determine the second degree polynomial used to generate a given sequence of three integers. As proof that you've figured out the polynomial, they want your program to print out the next 3 integers in the sequence. 
<br>
<br>You know that each sequence is generated by a polynomial of the form f(x) = Ax<sup>2</sup> + Bx + C, where A, B, and C are integers in the range (-10<sup>3</sup> <= (A, B, C) <= 10<sup>3</sup>). You are given the values f(0), f(1), f(2) and are to determine the values f(3), f(4), f(5). 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input to this problem will consist of a (non-empty) series of up to 100 data sets. Each data set will be formatted according to the following description, and there will be no blank lines separating data sets. 
<br>
<br>Each data set consists of a single line containing the space-separated integer values of the polynomial evaluated at 0, 1, and 2 (in that order). These values will be in the range (-10<sup>3</sup> <= (f(0), f(1), f(2)) <= 10<sup>3</sup>). </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each data set, there will be exactly one line of output containing the space-separated integer values of the polynomial evaluated at 3, 4, and 5 (in that order).
