</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Accounting for Computer Machinists (ACM) has sufferred from the Y2K bug and lost some vital data for preparing annual report for MS Inc. 
<br>All what they remember is that MS Inc. posted a surplus or a deficit each month of 1999 and each month when MS Inc. posted surplus, the amount of surplus was s and each month when MS Inc. posted deficit, the deficit was d. They do not remember which or how many months posted surplus or deficit. MS Inc., unlike other companies, posts their earnings for each consecutive 5 months during a year. ACM knows that each of these 8 postings reported a deficit but they do not know how much. The chief accountant is almost sure that MS Inc. was about to post surplus for the entire year of 1999. Almost but not quite.
