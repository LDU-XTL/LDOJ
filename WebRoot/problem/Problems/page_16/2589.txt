</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Snap is a 2-player card game. The deck of cards contains several of each type of card. Initially each player has one half of the deck, in some random sequence, face down in a pile, and plays them in sequence from top to bottom, placing each card face-up in another pile. When the face-down pile is exhausted, the face-up pile is turned over to become the face-down pile and play continues. 
<br>The two players play their cards concurrently and synchronously. That is, each places a card face up at exactly the same time. If two cards turned up at the same time are the same type, each player calls "Snap!" and the player who calls first takes the other's face-up pile and places it on top of his or her own. 
<br>
<br>Play proceeds until one player has all the cards. This player is the winner. 
<br>
<br>Your job is to simulate a game of snap to determine whether it will end within 1000 turns and, if so, to determine the winner. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each type of card is denoted by a single letter or digit.
