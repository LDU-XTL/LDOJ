</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation), a chessboard is described as follows: 
<br><ul><li>The Board-Content is specified starting with the top row and ending with the bottom row. 
<br><li>Character / is used to separate data of adjacent rows. 
<br><li>Each row is specified from left to right. 
<br><li>White pieces are identified by uppercase piece letters: PNBRQK. 
<br><li>Black pieces are identified by lowercase piece letters: pnbrqk. 
<br><li>Empty squares are represented by the numbers one through eight. 
<br><li>A number used represents the count of contiguous empty squares along a row. 
<br><li>Each row's sum of numbers and characters must equal 8. </ul>
