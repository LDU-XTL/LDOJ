<br>is a jolly jumper, because the absolutes differences are 3, 2, and 1 respectively. The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. You are to write a program to determine whether or not each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each line of input contains an integer n < 3000 followed by n integers representing the sequence.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each line of input, generate a line of output saying "Jolly" or "Not jolly".
