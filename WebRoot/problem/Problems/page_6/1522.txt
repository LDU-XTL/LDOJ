</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">An n-tersection is defined as a location in n-dimensional space, n being a positive integer, having all non-negative integer coordinates. For example, the location (1,2,3) represents an n-tersection in three dimensional space. Two n-tersections are said to be adjacent if they have the same number of dimensions and their coordinates differ by exactly 1 in a single dimension only. For example, (1,2,3) is adjacent to (0,2,3) and (2,2,3) and (1,2,4), but not to (2,3,3) or (3,2,3) or (1,2). An n-teresting space is defined as a collection of paths between adjacent n-tersections.
<br>
<br>Finally, an n-credible maze is defined as an n-teresting space combined with two specific n-tersections in that space, one of which is identified as the starting n-tersection and the other as the ending n-tersection.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input file will consist of the descriptions of one or more n-credible mazes. The first line of the description will specify n, the dimension of the n-teresting space. (For this problem, n will not exceed 10, and all coordinate values will be less than 10.) The next line will contain 2n non-negative integers, the first n of which describe the starting n-tersection, least dimension first, and the next n of which describe the ending n-tersection. Next will be a nonnegative number of lines containing 2n non-negative integers each, identifying paths between adjacent n-tersections in the n-teresting space. The list is terminated by a line containing only the value ï¿½. Several such maze descriptions may be present in the file. The end of the input is signalled by space dimension of zero. No further data will follow this terminating zero.
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each maze output it's position in the input; e.g. the first maze is "Maze #1", the second is "Maze #2", etc. If it is possible to travel through the n-credible maze's n-teresting space from the starting n-tersection to the ending n-tersection, also output "can be travelled" on the same line. If such travel is not possible, output "cannot be travelled" instead.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2
