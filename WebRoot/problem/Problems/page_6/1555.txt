</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Given the coefficients of a polynomial from degree 8 down to 0, you are to format the polynomial in a readable format with unnecessary characters removed. For instance, given the coefficients 0, 0, 0, 1, 22, -333, 0, 1, and -1, you should generate an output line which displays x^5 + 22x^4 - 333x^3 + x - 1. 
<br>The formatting rules which must be adhered to are as follows:
<br>
<br>1. Terms must appear in decreasing order of degree.
<br>
<br>2. Exponents should appear after a caret `"^".
<br>
<br>3. The constant term appears as only the constant.
<br>
<br>4. Only terms with nonzero coefficients should appear, unless all terms have zero coefficients in which case the constant term should appear.
<br>
<br>5. The only spaces should be a single space on either side of the binary + and - operators.
<br>
<br>6. If the leading term is positive then no sign should precede it; a negative leading term should be preceded by a minus sign, as in -7x^2 + 30x + 66.
<br>
<br>7. Negated terms should appear as a subtracted unnegated term (with the exception of a negative leading term which should appear as described above). That is, rather than x^2 + -3x, the output should be x^2 - 3x.
<br>
<br>8. The constants 1 and -1 should appear only as the constant term. That is, rather than -1x^3 + 1x^2 + 3x^1 - 1, the output should appear as-x^3 + x^2 + 3x - 1.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will contain one or more lines of coefficients delimited by one or more spaces.
