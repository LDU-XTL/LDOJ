</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">As part of an arithmetic competency program, your students will be given randomly generated lists of from 2 to 15 unique positive integers and asked to determine how many items in each list are twice some other item in the same list. You will need a program to help you with the grading. This program should be able to scan the lists and output the correct answer for each one. For example, given the list 
<br><center><pre>1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22</pre></center>
<br>your program should answer 3, as 2 is twice 1, 4 is twice 2, and 18 is twice 9. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will consist of one or more lists of numbers. There will be one list of numbers per line. Each list will contain from 2 to 15 unique positive integers. No integer will be larger than 99. Each line will be terminated with the integer 0, which is not considered part of the list. A line with the single number -1 will mark the end of the file. The example input below shows 3 separate lists. Some lists may not contain any doubles.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output will consist of one line per input list, containing a count of the items that are double some other item. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22 0
