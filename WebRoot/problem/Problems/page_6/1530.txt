<br>A Slurpy is a string of characters that has certain properties. Your program will read in strings of characters and output whether or not they are Slurpys. 
<br>
<br>A Slump is a character string that has the following properties: 
<br>
<br>1. Its first character is either a 'D' or an 'E'.
<br>
<br>2. The first character is followed by a string of one or more 'F's.
<br>
<br>3. The string of one or more 'F's is followed by either a Slump or a 'G'. The Slump or 'G' that follows the F's ends the Slump. For example DFFEFFFG is a Slump since it has a 'D' for its first character, followed by a string of two F's, and ended by the Slump 'EFFFG'.
<br>
<br>4. Nothing else is a Slump. 
<br>
<br>A Slimp is a character string that has the following properties: 
<br>
<br>1. Its first character is an 'A'.
<br>
<br>2. If it is a two character Slimp then its second and last character is an 'H'.
<br>
<br>3. If it is not a two character Slimp then it is in one of these two forms: 
<br>a) 'A' followed by 'B' followed by a Slimp followed by a 'C'. 
<br>b) 'A' followed by a Slump (see above) followed by a 'C'. 
<br>
<br>4. Nothing else is a Slimp. 
<br>
<br>A Slurpy is a character string that consists of a Slimp followed by a Slump.
