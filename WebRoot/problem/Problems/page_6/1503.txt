</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">One of the first users of BIT's new supercomputer was Chip Diller. He extended his exploration of powers of 3 to go from 0 to 333 and he explored taking various sums of those numbers. 
<br>``This supercomputer is great,'' remarked Chip. ``I only wish Timothy were here to see these results.'' (Chip moved to a new apartment, once one became available on the third floor of the Lemon Sky apartments on Third Street.) 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will consist of at most 100 lines of text, each of which contains a single VeryLongInteger. Each VeryLongInteger will be 100 or fewer characters in length, and will only contain digits (no VeryLongInteger will be negative). 
<br>
<br>The final input line will contain a single zero on a line by itself. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Your program should output the sum of the VeryLongIntegers given in the input. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">123456789012345678901234567890
