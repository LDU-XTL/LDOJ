</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>The country is facing a terrible civil war----cities in the country are divided into two parts supporting different leaders. As a merchant, Mr. M does not pay attention to politics but he actually knows the severe situation, and your task is to help him reach home as soon as possible. </p><p>"For the sake of safety,", said Mr.M, "your route should contain at most 1 road which connects two cities of different camp."</p><p>Would you please tell Mr. M at least how long will it take to reach his sweet home?</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>The input contains multiple test cases.</p><p>The first line of each case is an integer <i>N</i> (2<=<i>N</i><=600), representing the number of cities in the country.</p><p>The second line contains one integer <i>M</i> (0<=<i>M</i><=10000), which is the number of roads.</p><p>The following <i>M</i> lines are the information of the roads.
