</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For a string of n bits x1, x2, x3, …, xn, the adjacent bit count of the string (AdjBC(x)) is given by 
<br> 
<br>x1*x2 + x2*x3 + x3*x4 + … + xn-1*xn 
<br> 
<br>which counts the number of times a 1 bit is adjacent to another 1 bit.  For example: 
<br> 
<br>AdjBC(011101101) = 3 
<br>AdjBC(111101101) = 4 
<br>AdjBC(010101010) = 0 
<br> 
<br>Write a program which takes as input integers n and k and returns the number of bit strings x of n bits (out of 2ⁿ) that satisfy AdjBC(x) = k.  For example, for 5 bit strings, there are 6 ways of getting AdjBC(x) = 2: 
<br> 
<br>11100, 01110, 00111, 10111, 11101, 11011</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ≤ P ≤ 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow.  Each data set is a single line that contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by a decimal integer giving the number (n) of bits in the bit strings, followed by a single space, followed by a decimal integer (k) giving the desired adjacent bit count.  The number of bits (n) will not be greater than 100 and the parameters n and k will be chosen so that the result will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each data set there is one line of output.
