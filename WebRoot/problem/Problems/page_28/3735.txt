</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>Facer's pet cat just gave birth to a brood of little cats. Having considered the health of those lovely cats, Facer decides to make the cats to do some exercises. Facer has well designed a set of moves for his cats. He is now asking you to supervise the cats to do his exercises. Facer's great exercise for cats contains three different moves:<br>g i : Let the ith cat take a peanut.<br>e i : Let the ith cat eat all peanuts it have.<br>s i j : Let the ith cat and jth cat exchange their peanuts.<br>All the cats perform a sequence of these moves and must repeat it m times! Poor cats! Only Facer can come up with such embarrassing idea. <br>You have to determine the final number of peanuts each cat have, and directly give them the exact quantity in order to save them. </p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>The input file consists of multiple test cases, ending with three zeroes "0 0 0".
