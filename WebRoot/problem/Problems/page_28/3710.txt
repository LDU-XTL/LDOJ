They drew some Christmas trees on a paper: </p><div align="center"><img src="images/3710_1.png"> </div><p>Then they took turns to cut a branch of a tree, and removed the part of the tree which had already not connected with the root.

Who removed the last part of the trees would win the game. </p><p>After a while, they all figured out the best strategy and thought the game was too simple for them. Harry said, “The Christmas trees should have some gifts in them!” So Sally drew some gifts (simple polygons) in the initial trees: </p><div align="center"><img src="images/3710_3.png"> </div><p>You may assume the initial picture is a tree with some simple polygons, in which each edge is involved in at most one polygon. We also know that every polygon has only one node involved in the main tree (the hanging point of the giftJ) .In every sub-tree (connected subgraph), there was one and only one node representing the “root”. According to these assumptions, following graphs will never appear: </p><div align="center"><img src="images/3710_4.png"> </div><p>Sally and Harry took turns (Sally was always the first person to move), to cut an edge in the graph, and removed the part of the tree that no longer connected to the root. The person who cannot make a move lost the game. </p><p>Your job is to decide who will finally win the game if both of them use the best strategy. </p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>The input file contains multiply test cases.<br>The first line of each test case is an integer <i>N</i> (<i>N</i>&lt;100), which represents the number of sub-trees.
