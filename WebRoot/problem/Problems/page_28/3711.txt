One side of the triangle represents the year of the kings death, another represents the month, and the last represents the day. The height of the pyramid represents the king's age. </p><p>In the following picture, we see a Mayan pyramid. We have already known the coordinates of <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>. And we know the height of <i>P</i>. <i>Q</i> is the projection of <i>P</i>. Because of the Mayan religion, they want <i>PD</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>PE</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>PF</i><sup>2</sup> to be as small as possible. </p><div align="center"><img src="images/3711_1.JPG"> </div></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div>The input consists of one or more test cases ended with <b>EOF</b>.
