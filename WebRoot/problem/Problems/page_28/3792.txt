</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A polycube is a solid made by gluing together unit cubes (one unit on each edge) on one or more faces.  The figure in the lower-left is not a polycube because some cubes are attached along an edge.

<br>
<br>For this problem, the polycube will be formed from unit cubes centered at integer lattice points in 3-space.  The polycube will be built up one cube at a time, starting with a cube centered at (0,0,0).  At each step of the process (after the first cube), the next cube must have a face in common with a cube previously included and not be the same as a block previously included.  For example, a 1-by-1-by-5 block (as shown above in the upper-left polycube) could be built up as: 
<br> 
<br>(0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,0,2) (0,0,3) (0,0,4) 
<br> 
<br>and a 2-by-2-by-2 cube (upper-right figure) could be built as: 
<br> 
<br>(0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,1,1) (0,1,0) (1,0,0) (1,0,1) (1,1,1) (1,1,0)
<br>
<br>Since the surface of the polycube is made up of unit squares, its area is an integer. 
<br> 
<br>Write a program which takes as input a sequence of integer lattice points in 3-space and determines whether is correctly forms a polycube and, if so, what the surface area of the polycube is.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 <= N <= 1000) which is the number of data sets that follow.  Each data set consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains the number of points P, (1 <= P <= 100) in the problem instance.  Each succeeding line contains the centers of the cubes, eight to a line (except possibly for the last line).  Each center is given as 3 integers, separated by commas.  The points are separated by a single space.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each data set, you should generate one line of output with the following values:  The data set number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space and the surface area of the polycube if it is correctly formed, OR, if it is not correctly formed, the string “NO” a space and the index (starting with 1) of the  first cube which does not share a face with a previous cube.  Note that the surface area includes the area of any included holes.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">4
