</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">An <b>equal sum partition</b> of a sequence of numbers is a grouping of the numbers (in the same order as the original sequence) in such a way that each group has the same sum.  For example, the sequence: 
<br>2 5 1 3 3 7 
<br> 
<br>may be grouped as: 
<br>(2 5) (1 3 3) (7) 
<br> 
<br>to yield an equal sum of 7. 
<br> 
<br>Note: The partition that puts all the numbers in a single group is an equal sum partition with the sum equal to the sum of all the numbers in the sequence. 
<br> 
<br>For this problem, you will write a program that takes as input a sequence of positive integers and returns the smallest sum for an equal sum partition of the sequence. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ≤ P ≤ 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow.  The first line of each data set contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by 
<br>a decimal integer M, (1 ≤ M ≤ 10000), giving the total number of integers in the sequence.  The remaining line(s) in the dataset consist of the values, 10 per line, separated by a single space.  The last line in the dataset may contain less than 10 values.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each data set, generate one line of output with the following values:  The data set number as a decimal integer, a space, and the smallest sum for an equal sum partition of the sequence.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3
