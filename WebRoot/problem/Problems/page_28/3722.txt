He intends to send a troop going through the long straight blockade line secretly and spying into enemy's activities. </p><p>After several days' observation, the Commander finds the following facts: <ul><li>The blockade line is <i>L</i> meters long and there are <i>N</i> Empire's soldiers patrolling along the line.</li><li>The soldiers move one meter per second.</li><li>Each soldier's vision covers a range of <i>R</i> meters, both in front of and behind him.</li><li>When a soldier meets (the soldier meets, not his vision meets) an end of the line, he turns around and continues his patrol.</li></ul></p><p>The whole break-through will last <i>T</i> seconds. To make sure the action successes, Yang wants to maximize the average uncovered length during the <i>T</i> seconds. In another word, assuming the function <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) indicating the uncovered length of the blockade line at time <i>t</i>. Yang wants to maximize the definite integral:</p><p><img src="formula?tex=I%28x%29%3D%5Cint_%7Bx%7D%5E%7Bx%2BT%7D+f%28t%29dt+%5Cqquad+%28x+%5Cgeq+0%29%E3%80%80" alt="I(x)=\int_{x}^{x+T} f(t)dt \qquad (x \geq 0)　" align="absmiddle"></p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>The first line of input contains four integers, <i>L</i>, <i>R</i>, <i>N</i>, <i>T</i> (0 &le; <i>L</i>, <i>R</i>, <i>T</i> &le; 1000000), (0 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100).</p><p>The following <i>N</i> lines describe the soldiers.
