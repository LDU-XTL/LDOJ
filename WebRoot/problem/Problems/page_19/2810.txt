<br>
<br>A U R V
<br>
<br>where A is the amount of a vitamin/mineral present in one serving of the food product, U is the units in which A is measured, R is the minimum daily requirement for that vitamin/mineral, measured in the same units as A , and V is the name of that vitamin/mineral. A and R will be floating point numbers. U will be a string of alphabetic characters with no embedded spaces. V will be a string of characters, possibly including spaces. A , U , R , and V will be separated from one another by exactly one space, and V is terminated by the end of the input line. End of the input is signaled by a line in which A is negative. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each line of input data, your program should determine the percentage of the recommended daily requirement being provided for that vitamin/mineral. If it is at least 1% , your program should print a line of the form
<br>
<br>V A U P %
<br>
<br>where V , A , and U are the quantities from the input, and P is the percentage of the minimum daily requirement represented by the amount A .
<br>
<br>V should be printed left-justified on the line. A should be printed with 1 digit precision, and P with zero digits precision. V , A , U , and P should be separated by one space each.
<br>
<br>After the last such line, your program should print a line stating

<br>followed by a list of the names of all vitamins/minerals which are provided as less than 1% of the minimum daily requirement. These should be printed one name per line, in the order they occurred within the input.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3500.0 iu 5000.0 Vitamin A
