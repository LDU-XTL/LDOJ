The follow n lines contain two integer numbers x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub>, which describes the coordinate of each point. Then the next line contains an integer number m, which is the number of triangles, and there are 6 integer numbers ax<sub>i</sub>, ay<sub>i</sub>, bx<sub>i</sub>, by<sub>i</sub>, cx<sub>i</sub> and cy<sub>i</sub> in each of the follow m lines, which describe the coordinate of vertices in a triangle.
