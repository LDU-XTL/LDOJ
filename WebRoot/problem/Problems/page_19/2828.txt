Now, he had to travel by train to Mianyang, Sichuan Province for the winter camp selection of the national team of Olympiad in Informatics.</p><p>It was one o&rsquo;clock a.m. and dark outside. Chill wind from the northwest did not scare off the people in the queue. The cold night gave the Little Cat a shiver. Why not find a problem to think about? That was none the less better than freezing to death!</p><p>People kept jumping the queue. Since it was too dark around, such moves would not be discovered even by the people adjacent to the queue-jumpers. &ldquo;If every person in the queue is assigned an integral value and all the information about those who have jumped the queue and where they stand after queue-jumping is given, can I find out the final order of people in the queue?&rdquo; Thought the Little Cat.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case consists of <i>N</i> + 1 lines where <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 200,000) is given in the first line of the test case. The next <i>N</i> lines contain the pairs of values <i>Pos<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>Val<sub>i</sub></i> in the increasing order of <i>i</i> (1 &le; <i>i</i> &le; <i>N</i>). For each <i>i</i>, the ranges and meanings of <i>Pos<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>Val<sub>i</sub></i> are as follows:</p><ul><li><i>Pos<sub>i</sub></i> &isin; [0, <i>i</i> &minus; 1] &mdash; The <i>i</i>-th person came to the queue and stood right behind the <i>Pos<sub>i</sub></i>-th person in the queue.
