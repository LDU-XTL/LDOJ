</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p><i>N</i> children are sitting in a circle to play a game.</p><p>The children are numbered from 1 to <i>N</i> in clockwise order. Each of them has a card with a non-zero integer on it in his/her hand. The game starts from the <i>K</i>-th child, who tells all the others the integer on his card and jumps out of the circle. The integer on his card tells the next child to jump out. Let <i>A</i> denote the integer. If <i>A</i> is positive, the next child will be the <i>A</i>-th child to the left. If <i>A</i> is negative, the next child will be the (<span lang="en-us">&minus;</span><i>A</i>)-th child to the right.</p><p>The game lasts until all children have jumped out of the circle. During the game, the <i>p</i>-th child jumping out will get <i>F</i>(<i>p</i>) candies where <i>F</i>(<i>p</i>) is the number of positive integers that perfectly divide <i>p</i>.
