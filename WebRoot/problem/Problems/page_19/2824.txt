At the beginning of the game, a unit circle was drawn on a piece of paper. Then a point (<I>x</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB>0</SUB>) in the circle and <I>N</I> (1 &le; <I>N</I> &le; 1000) vectors (&Delta;<I>x<SUB>i</SUB></I>, &Delta;<I>y<SUB>i</SUB></I>) were randomly chosen. At the <I>i</I>-th step of the gambling, a player draw a segment from the point (<I>x</I><SUB><I>i</I> &minus; 1</SUB>, <I>y</I><SUB><I>i</I> &minus; 1</SUB>) to (<I>x<SUB>i</SUB></I>, <I>y<SUB>i</SUB></I>), where <I>x<SUB>i</SUB></I> = <I>x</I><SUB><I>i</I> &minus; 1</SUB> + &Delta;<I>x<SUB>i</SUB></I> and <I>y<SUB>i</SUB></I> = <I>y</I><SUB><I>i</I> &minus; 1</SUB> + &Delta;<I>y<SUB>i</SUB></I>. If (<I>x<SUB>i</SUB></I>, <I>y<SUB>i</SUB></I>) was outside the circle or on its boundary, the game ended; otherwise the player would win some money and go on to the next step of the gambling until all <I>N</I> lines had been drawn.
<br><P>As a predictor, Mercury had known all the vectors chosen for the gambling in advance, but he didn't know what the starting point would be. His clients asked him to find how much money they could win under average conditions, which meant the point would be chosen within the circle with uniformly distributed probability. They also wondered how much they could win if everything went the luckiest way. What would Mercury's reply to his clients be?</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of one or more data sets, followed by a last line containing a single zero.

Then follow <I>N</I> lines, each containing two real numbers and an integer referring to &Delta;<I>x<SUB>i</SUB></I>, &Delta;<I>y<SUB>i</SUB></I> and the money that a player could win after the <I>i</I>-th step.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each test case your program should output two lines.
