</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Some problems are difficult to solve but have a simplification that is easy to solve. Rather than deal with the difficulties of constructing a model of the Earth (a somewhat oblate spheroid), consider a pre-Columbian flat world that is a 500 kilometer x 500 kilometer square. 
<br>In the model used in this problem, the flat world consists of several warring kingdoms. Though warlike, the people of the world are strict isolationists; each kingdom is surrounded by a high (but thin) wall designed to both protect the kingdom and to isolate it. To avoid fights for power, each kingdom has its own electric power plant. 
<br>When the urge to fight becomes too great, the people of a kingdom often launch missiles at other kingdoms. Each SCUD missile (anitary leansing niversal estroyer) that lands within the walls of a kingdom destroys that kingdom's power plant (without loss of life). 
<br>
<br>Given coordinate locations of several kingdoms (by specifying the locations of houses and the location of the power plant in a kingdom) and missile landings you are to write a program that determines the total area of all kingdoms that are without power after an exchange of missile fire. 
<br>In the simple world of this problem kingdoms do not overlap. Furthermore, the walls surrounding each kingdom are considered to be of zero thickness. The wall surrounding a kingdom is the minimal-perimeter wall that completely surrounds all the houses and the power station that comprise a kingdom; the area of a kingdom is the area enclosed by the minimal-perimeter thin wall. 
<br>There is exactly one power station per kingdom. 
<br>There may be empty space between kingdoms. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input is a sequence of kingdom specifications followed by a sequence of missile landing locations. 
<br>A kingdom is specified by a number N (3 <= N <= 100) on a single line which indicates the number of sites in this kingdom. The next line contains the x and y coordinates of the power station, followed by N-1 lines of x, y pairs indicating the locations of homes served by this power station. A value of -1 for N indicates that there are no more kingdoms. There will be at least one kingdom in the data set. 
<br>Following the last kingdom specification will be the coordinates of one or more missile attacks, indicating the location of a missile landing. Each missile location is on a line by itself. You are to process missile attacks until you reach the end of the file. 
<br>Locations are specified in kilometers using coordinates on a 500 km by 500 km grid. All coordinates will be integers between 0 and 500 inclusive. Coordinates are specified as a pair of integers separated by white-space on a single line. The input file will consist of up to 20 kingdoms, followed by any number of missile attacks.
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output consists of a single number representing the total area of all kingdoms without electricity after all missile attacks have been processed. The number should be printed with (and correct to) two decimal places.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">12
