</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A Bank plans to install a machine for cash withdrawal. The machine is able to deliver appropriate @ bills for a requested cash amount. The machine uses exactly N distinct bill denominations, say Dk, k=1,N, and for each denomination Dk the machine has a supply of nk bills. For example,
<br> 
<br>N=3, n1=10, D1=100, n2=4, D2=50, n3=5, D3=10
<br>
<br>means the machine has a supply of 10 bills of @100 each, 4 bills of @50 each, and 5 bills of @10 each. 
<br>
<br>Call cash the requested amount of cash the machine should deliver and write a program that computes the maximum amount of cash less than or equal to cash that can be effectively delivered according to the available bill supply of the machine. 
<br>
<br>Notes:
<br>@ is the symbol of the currency delivered by the machine. For instance, @ may stand for dollar, euro, pound etc.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The program input is from standard input. Each data set in the input stands for a particular transaction and has the format:
<br>
<br>cash N n1 D1 n2 D2 ... nN DN
<br>
<br>where 0 <= cash <= 100000 is the amount of cash requested, 0 <=N <= 10 is the number of bill denominations and 0 <= nk <= 1000 is the number of available bills for the Dk denomination,  1 <= Dk <= 1000, k=1,N. White spaces can occur freely between the numbers in the input. The input data are correct. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each set of data the program prints the result to the standard output on a separate line as shown in the examples below.
<br></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">735 3  4 125  6 5  3 350

0</pre><p class="pst">Hint</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first data set designates a transaction where the amount of cash requested is @735. The machine contains 3 bill denominations: 4 bills of @125, 6 bills of @5, and 3 bills of @350. The machine can deliver the exact amount of requested cash.  
<br>
<br>In the second case the bill supply of the machine does not fit the exact amount of cash requested. The maximum cash that can be delivered is @630.  Notice that there can be several possibilities to combine the bills in the machine for matching the delivered cash.
<br>
<br>In the third case the machine is empty and no cash is delivered. In the fourth case the amount of cash requested is @0 and, therefore, the machine delivers no cash.</div><p class="pst">
