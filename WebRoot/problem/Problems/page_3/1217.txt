<br>There is no difference between Heads/Tails and Tails/Heads. As you can see, the odds are stacked in Player A's favor. At the beginning of the game, each player has 0 points, and points accumulate as the game progresses. At the
<br>end of the game, whichever player has the most points wins.
<br>You must write a program that determines the probability that Player A will win, Player B will win, or they will tie, after a certain number of rounds. Assume that the coins are fair, i.e. that heads and tails are equally likely.
