</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A certain prison contains a long hall of n cells, each right next to each other. Each cell has a prisoner in it, and each cell is locked.
<br>One night, the jailer gets bored and decides to play a game. For round 1 of the game, he takes a drink of whiskey,and then runs down the hall unlocking each cell. For round 2, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the
<br>hall locking every other cell (cells 2, 4, 6, ?). For round 3, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the hall. He visits every third cell (cells 3, 6, 9, ?). If the cell is locked, he unlocks it; if it is unlocked, he locks it. He
<br>repeats this for n rounds, takes a final drink, and passes out.
<br>Some number of prisoners, possibly zero, realizes that their cells are unlocked and the jailer is incapacitated. They immediately escape.
<br>Given the number of cells, determine how many prisoners escape jail.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains a single positive integer.
