</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There are n distinct points in the plane, given by their integer coordinates. Find the number of parallelograms whose vertices lie on these points. In other words, find the number of 4-element subsets of these points that can be written as {A, B, C, D} such that AB || CD, and BC || AD. No four points are in a straight line. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases. It is followed by the input data for each test case.
<br>The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 1000). Each of the next n lines, contains 2 space-separated integers x and y (the coordinates of a point) with magnitude (absolute value) of no more than 1000000000.
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output should contain t lines.
<br>Line i contains an integer showing the number of the parallelograms as described above for test case i.
