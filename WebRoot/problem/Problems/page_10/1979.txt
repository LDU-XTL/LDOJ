</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There is a rectangular room, covered with square tiles. Each tile is colored either red or black. A man is standing on a black tile. From a tile, he can move to one of four adjacent tiles. But he can't move on red tiles, he can move only on black tiles. 
<br>
<br>Write a program to count the number of black tiles which he can reach by repeating the moves described above. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of multiple data sets. A data set starts with a line containing two positive integers W and H; W and H are the numbers of tiles in the x- and y- directions, respectively. W and H are not more than 20. 
<br>
<br>There are H more lines in the data set, each of which includes W characters. Each character represents the color of a tile as follows. 
<br>
<br>'.' - a black tile 
<br>'#' - a red tile 
<br>'@' - a man on a black tile(appears exactly once in a data set) 
<br>The end of the input is indicated by a line consisting of two zeros. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each data set, your program should output a line which contains the number of tiles he can reach from the initial tile (including itself). </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">6 9
