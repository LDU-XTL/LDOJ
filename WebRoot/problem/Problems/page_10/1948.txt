</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Like everyone, cows enjoy variety.  Their current fancy is new shapes for pastures.  The old rectangular shapes are out of favor; new geometries are the favorite.
<br>
<br>I. M. Hei, the lead cow pasture architect, is in charge of creating a triangular pasture surrounded by nice white fence rails.  She is supplied with N (3 <= N <= 40) fence segments (each of integer length Li (1 <= Li <= 40) and must arrange them into a triangular pasture with the largest grazing area.  Ms. Hei must use all the rails to create three sides of non-zero length.
<br>
<br>Help Ms. Hei convince the rest of the herd that plenty of grazing land will be available.Calculate the largest area that may be enclosed with a supplied set of fence segments.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer N
<br>
<br>* Lines 2..N+1: N lines, each with a single integer representing one fence segment's length.  The lengths are not necessarily unique.
