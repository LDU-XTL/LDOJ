</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A krunched word has no vowels ("A", "E", "I", "O", and "U") and no repeated letters.  Removing vowels and letters that appear twice or more from MISSISSIPPI yields MSP.  In a krunched word, a letter appears only once, the first time it would appear in the unkrunched word.  Vowels never appear.
<br>
<br>Krunched phrases similarly have no vowels and no repeated letters. Consider this phrase:
<br><pre>        RAILROAD CROSSING</pre>
<br>and its krunched version:
<br><pre>        RLD CSNG</pre>
<br>Blanks are krunched differently. Blanks are removed so that a krunched phrase has no blanks on its beginning or end, never has two blanks in a row, and has no blanks before punctuation.  Otherwise, blanks not removed. If we represent blanks by "_",
<br><pre>        MADAM_I_SAY_I_AM_ADAM__</pre>
<br>krunches to:
<br><pre>        MD_SY</pre>
<br>where the single remaining blank is shown by "_".
<br>
<br>Write a program that reads a line of input (whose length ranges from 2 to 70 characters), and krunches it.  Put the krunched word or phrase in the output file.  The input line has only capital letters, blanks, and the standard punctuation marks: period, comma, and question mark.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A single line to be krunched.
