The stones are dropping into one of the bunkers until the weight of this bunker’s content will exceed the weight of stones in other bunker by more than D. Then the gutter switches to the other bunker. At the beginning both bunkers are empty, and the first stone falls into the bunker А.</p><p>The task is to collect stones with maximum total cost in bunker B after all stones have been dropped.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of <i>N </i>+ 1 lines.
