</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>When wondering through the labyrinth, the goal is usually to find some kind of door. Well, not this time.</p><p>A labyrinth consists of <i>N</i> × <i>N</i> cells, each 1 × 1 meter in size. Cells are separated by doors. Each door opens in a specific direction (as shown on the picture):</p><p>1. left outwards;<br>2. left inwards;<br>3. right outwards;<br>4. right inwards. </p><p>So a cell can be represented by two numbers describing doors on its eastern and southern sides according to the list above. The doors are just slightly less then 1 meter in width. The traveler in the labyrinth is also slightly less then 1 meter in diameter, so he has following limitations:</p><p>* He can not pull doors, only push them.<br>* After opening the door and entering the cell it leads to, he can not take a turn in the direction where the door opened, because the passage is blocked by the door. Doors have springs and close automatically when traveler leaves the cell. </p><p>Your program must find the shortest path for the traveler from north-western cell (1, 1) to south-eastern cell (<i>N</i>, <i>N</i>).</p><img src="images/3426_1.gif"></img> </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Input file contains labyrinth size <i>N</i> followed by 2 × <i>N</i><sup>2</sup> numbers describing doors for each cell row by row.
