</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Everybody is fond of computers, but buying a new one is always a money challenge. Fortunately, there is always a convenient way to deal with. You can replace your computer and get a brand new one, thus saving some maintenance cost. Of course, you must pay a fixed cost for each new computer you get.</p><p>Suppose you are considering an <i>n</i> year period over which you want to have a computer. Suppose you buy a new computer in year <i>y</i>, <i>1&lt;=y&lt;=n</i> Then you have to pay a fixed cost <i>c</i>, in the year <i>y</i>, and a maintenance cost <i>m(y,z)</i> each year you own that computer, starting from year <i>y</i> through the year <i>z</i>, <i>z&lt;=n</i>, when you plan to buy - eventually - another computer.</p><p>Write a program that computes the minimum cost of having a computer over the <i>n</i> year period.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The program input is from a text file. Each data set in the file stands for a particular set of costs. A data set starts with the cost <i>c</i> for getting a new computer. Follows the number <i>n</i> of years, and the maintenance costs <i>m(y,z)</i>, <i>y=1..n</i>, <i>z=y..n</i>. The program prints the minimum cost of having a computer throughout the <i>n</i> year period.</p><p>White spaces can occur freely in the input.
