</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>On an <i>N</i> &times; <i>N</i> chessboard with a non-negative number in each grid, Kaka starts his matrix travels with <i>SUM</i> = 0. For each travel, Kaka moves one rook from the left-upper grid to the right-bottom one, taking care that the rook moves only to the right or down. Kaka adds the number to <i>SUM </i>in each grid the rook visited, and replaces it with zero. It is not difficult to know the maximum <i>SUM</i> Kaka can obtain for his first travel. Now Kaka is wondering what is the maximum <i>SUM</i> he can obtain after his <i>K</i>th travel. Note the <i>SUM</i> is accumulative during the <i>K</i> travels.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line contains two integers <i>N</i> and <i>K</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 50, 0 &le; <i>K</i> &le; 10) described above.
