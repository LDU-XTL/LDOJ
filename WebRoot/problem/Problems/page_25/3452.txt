</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>ACM has created a new series of huge billboards. Now, they have to be transported using a train. Unfortunately, the carriages of the train get somehow mixed, but ACM wants the billboards to be delivered in an appropriate order.</p><p><center><img src="images/3452_1.PNG"></center></p><p>In a small example, we have 5 carriages approaching a railroad station with 3 parallel tracks. Each carriage may enter any track, but once it is there, it cannot go back anymore. At the other end, the tracks are merged back to a single railroad and cannot go back, again. We want the carriages to leave their tracks in the correct order.</p><p>Possible solution is illustrated in the second figure. We may send carriage 4 to the first track, then the carriage number 2 to the second one, number 5 to the first, number 3 to the second, and finally, number 1 to the third track, which may immediately leave it to its correct position. The other carriages will follow as needed.</p><p><center><img src="images/3452_2.PNG"></center></p><p>Your task is to write a program that sends carriages to correct tracks and merges them at the other end. You may assume that the tracks are long enough to hold any number of carriages.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of several scenarios, each of them described on two lines. End of the input is signalized by two zeros.</p><p>The first line of each scenario contains two positive integers N and M, separated with a space, N ≤ 200000, M ≤ 200000. N is the number of carriages, M is the number of tracks.</p><p>The second line will contain N non-negative integers representing carriages and their intended order on the other end of the station. Some carriages may have identical numbers, in such a case, their mutual order is not significant.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each scenario, output two lines. The first line will contain N numbers, each of them between 1 and M inclusive. Each number corresponds to one carriage (in the order they were given in the input) and determines a track the carriage is to be moved to. The second line also contains N numbers, they specify from what tracks and in which order are the carriages sent to the other end of the station.</p><p>If carriages are manipulated according to your answer, they must leave the station in a nondescending order. When there are more solutions, you may print any of them. If there is no solution, print only one line containing the words Transportation failed”.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">5 3
