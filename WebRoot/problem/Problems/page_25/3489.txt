</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Lambert wants to carry several kinds of items with a knapsack. Items of each kind have integral size and infinite supply. The knapsack also has an integral capacity. Due to some esoteric reasons, an item of any kind can be divided evenly into a fixed number of identical parts. The resulting parts can again be divided, and the process of even division can go on endlessly. Given <i>n</i> kinds of items, can the capacity of the knapsack be fulfilled?</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing three positive integers <i>n</i>, <i>x</i> and <i>k</i> (<i>n</i> &le; 1000, <i>k</i> &ge; 2), where <i>x</i> is the capacity of the knapsack, and <i>k</i> means each division divides an item or a divided part into <i>k</i> identical smaller parts. Then comes a line containing <i>n</i> positive integers, the sizes of different kinds of items.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each test case, output one line containing &ldquo;<tt>Yes</tt>&rdquo; if the knapsack can be fulfilled or &ldquo;<tt>No</tt>&rdquo; otherwise.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2 3 5
