</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Bob is a skilled engineer. He must design a highway that crosses a region with few villages. Since this region is quite unpopulated, he wants to minimize the number of exits from the highway. He models the highway as a line segment <i>S</i> (starting from zero), the villages as points on a plane, and the exits as points on <i>S</i>. Considering that the highway and the villages position are known, Bob must find the minimum number of exists such that each village location is at most at the distance <i>D</i> from at least one exit. He knows that all village locations are at most at the distance <i>D</i> from <i>S</i>.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The program input is from a text file. Each data set in the file stands for a particular set of a highway and the positions of the villages. The data set starts with the length <i>L</i> (fits an integer) of the highway. Follows the distance <i>D</i> (fits an integer), the number <i>N</i> of villages, and for each village the location <i>(x,y)</i>. The program prints the minimum number of exits.</p><p>White spaces can occur freely in the input. The input data are correct and terminate with an end of file.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each set of data the program prints the result to the standard output from the beginning of a line. An input/output sample is in the table below. There is a single data set. The highway length <i>L</i> is <i>100</i>, the distance <i>D</i> is <i>50</i>. There are <i>3</i> villages having the locations <i>(2, 4)</i>, <i>(50, 10)</i>, <i>(70, 30)</i>. The result for the data set is the minimum number of exits: <i>1</i>.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">100
