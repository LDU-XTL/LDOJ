</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>In a certain week, a company wants to finish <i>m</i> projects. To this end, the company can employ at most <i>n</i> people from the unemployment agency for a period of one week. Each external employee will cost the company <tt>salary</tt> euro, unless the project in which he/she is involved is not completed in time. In that case no payment is due.</p><p>For each project the company knows from experience the probability that the project will be completed within a week, as a function of the number of employees working on it. These probabilities are given as percentages <i>p<sub>ij</sub></i>, where <i>i</i> (with 1 &#8804; <i>i</i> &#8804; <i>m</i>) is the number of the project and <i>j</i> is the number of people working on it. Of course, when nobody is working on a project <i>i</i>, the probability <i>p<sub>i</sub></i><sub>0</sub> is zero percent.</p><p>If project <i>i</i> is indeed finished within a week, the company earns <tt>reward</tt>(<i>i</i>) euro; if it is not ready in time, the company has to pay a fine of <tt>punishment</tt>(<i>i</i>) euro.</p><p>Of course the company wants to maximise its total expected profit<sup>1</sup> at the end of the week by finding the optimal number of external employees to hire, and how to divide them over the projects. The optimal number of employees is the total number of people needed to achieve the maximal expected profit. Your task in this matter is to calculate this optimal number of external employees. Remember that at most <i>n</i> people are available. Furthermore: if a person is employed, he/she works on one and only one project.</p><hr noshade width="30%" align="left" size="1" color="#000000"><p><small><sup>1</sup>Let <i>p</i> (0 &lt; <i>p</i> &lt; 1) be the probability that a job is finished in time, and let <i>E</i><sub>1</sub> be the profit in that case.
