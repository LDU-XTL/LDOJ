Given a chessboard in such a way that every grid is presented by a specified integer, you are obliged to color every grid in white or black. For each pair of grids subjected to following restraints:</p><ol><li>they are neighbor, in detail, sharing common edge;</li><li>they are colored differently.</li></ol><p>add the product of the two specified integers to the score. And your goal is to maximum the total score. Could you write a program to tell John the maximum score?</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input describes one puzzle which begins with two integer <i>n</i>,<i> m</i>(1 ≤<i> n</i>,<i> m </i>≤16). Then <i>n</i> lines follow. Each contains <i>m</i> integers. The <i>j</i>-th number on <i>i</i>-th row corresponds to the grid(<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>). The absolute value of each number is less than 1000.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Print the maximum score in a line. 　</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">5 5
