</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>To complete a role-playing game (RPG), you must send your character through <b>N</b> quests. The quests may be passed in any order, but after starting a quest you can&#8217;t drop it and switch to another. If your character fails even one quest you fail the whole game. The probability of succeeding in a quest depends on the experience points (<b>XP</b>) of your character at the beginning of the quest, and is determined by the formula<br><img src="images/3413_1.png" align="absmiddle"> where <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>b<sub>i</sub></b> are parameters of the <b>i</b>-th quest.<br>After successful completion of the <b>i</b>-th quest, your character obtains <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> experience points.
