</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For any decimal fraction, we can obtain a set of approximations of different accuracy by mean of rounding. Take 0.2503 for example, we have the following approximations:</p><ul><li>0.2503</li><li>0.250</li><li>0.25</li><li>0.3</li><li>0.</li></ul><p>If two fractions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> can both be rounded to <i>C</i>, we call <i>C</i> a <i>common approximation</i> of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. Two fractions may have more than one common approximations, each having a distinct accuracy. For example, 0.2503 and 0.2504 have common approximations 0.250 and 0.25. The accuracy of the former is 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup>, while that of the latter is 10<sup>&#8722;2</sup>. Among all common approximations of two fractions, there is one that has the highest accuracy, and we call it the <i>most accurate common approximation</i> (MACA) of the two fractions. By this definition, the MACA of 0.2503 and 0.2504 is 0.250.</p><p>Given <i>N</i> fractions <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> (1 &#8804; <i>i</i> &#8804; <i>N</i>) in the range [0, 0.5), find a fraction <i>x</i> that maximizes the sum of &#8722;log<sub>10</sub> (the accuracy of the MACA of <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>x</i>).
