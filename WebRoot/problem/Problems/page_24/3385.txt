</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Alien Peter wants to trace his family pedigrees. Working hard for several weeks, he has created a beta-version of his family tree. Unfortunately, some of his ancestors have too much parents in this tree (aliens have <i>d</i> parents). So Peter thinks that some of parent-child relations actually are ancestor-descendant relations. Now Peter wants to know, what minimal number of ancestors need to be added to the tree to make it look well-formed (family tree looks well-formed if each alien has no more than <i>d</i> parents, each alien must appear at the tree only once).</p><p>For example, if <i>d</i> = 2, and beta-version of the family tree looks like this:</p><div align="center"><img src="images/3385_1.png"></div><p>then Peter should add at least two ancestors to make it look well-formed:</p><div align="center"><img src="images/3385_2.png"></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Let Peter&#8217;s ancestors, appeared in the beta-version of his family tree, have identifiers from 1 to <i>n</i> (let Peter&#8217;s identifier be 0).</p><p>The first line of input file contains numbers n and d (2 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 100 000, 2 &le; <i>d</i> &le; <i>n</i>).
