It also serves as a tool, a building block for a number of other computational-geometric algorithms. For example, consider the problem of finding the diameter of a set of points, which is the pair of points a maximum distance apart. The diameter will always be the distance between two points on the convex hull.</p><p>For planar objects, i.e., lying in the plane, the convex hull may be easily visualized by imagining an elastic band stretched open to encompass the given objects; when released, it will assume the shape of the required convex hull. It may seem natural to generalise this picture to higher dimensions by imagining the objects enveloped in a sort of idealized unpressurized elastic membrane or balloon under tension. However, the equilibrium (minimum-energy) surface in this case may not be the convex hull-parts of the resulting surface may have negative curvature, like a saddle surface. For the case of points in 3-dimensional space, if a rigid wire is first placed between each pair of points, then the balloon will spring back under tension to take the form of the convex hull of the points."
