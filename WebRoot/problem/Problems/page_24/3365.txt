The circle will form the bottom of the cylinder.</li><li>Roll the second part up in such a way
<br>that it has a perimeter of equal length with the circle's circumference, and attach one end of the roll to the circle. Note that the roll may have some overlapping parts in order to get the required length of the perimeter.</li></ol><p>Given the dimensions of the sheet of paper, can you calculate the biggest possible volume of a cylinder which can be constructed using the procedure described above?</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of several test cases.
