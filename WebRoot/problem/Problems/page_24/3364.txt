In particular you notice one painting which consists solely of black and white squares, arranged in rows and columns like in a chess board (no two adjacent squares have the same colour). By the way, the artist did not use the tool of problem A to create the painting.</p><p>Since you are bored, you wonder how many <i>8 &times; 8</i> chess boards are embedded within this painting. The bottom right corner of a chess board must always be white.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of one line with three integers <strong>n</strong>, <strong>m</strong> and <strong>c</strong>. (<i>8 &le; n, m &le; 40000</i>), where <strong>n</strong> is the number of rows of the painting, and <strong>m</strong> is the number of columns of the painting. <strong>c</strong> is always <i>0</i> or <i>1</i>, where <i>0</i> indicates that the bottom right corner of the painting is black, and <i>1</i> indicates that this corner is white.</p><p>The last test case is followed by a line containing three zeros.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each test case, print the number of chess boards embedded within the given painting.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">8 8 0
