</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>A racing bicycle is driven by a chain connecting two sprockets. Sprockets are grouped into two clusters: the front cluster (typically consisting of 2 or 3 sprockets) and the rear cluster (typically consisting of between 5 and 10 sprockets). At any time the chain connects one of the front sprockets to one of the rear sprockets. The drive ratio -- the ratio of the angular velocity of the pedals to that of the wheels -- is <i>n </i>:<i> m</i> where <i>n</i> is the number of teeth on the rear sprocket and <i>m</i> is the number of teeth on the front sprocket. Two drive ratios <i>d</i><sub>1 </sub>&lt;<i> d</i><sub>2</sub> are adjacent if there is no other drive ratio <i>d</i><sub>1 </sub>&lt;<i> d</i><sub>3 </sub>&lt;<i> d</i><sub>2</sub>. The <i>spread</i> between a pair of drive ratios <i>d</i><sub>1 </sub>&lt;<i> d</i><sub>2</sub> is their quotient: <i>d</i><sub>2</sub> &frasl; <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>. You are to compute the maximum spread between two adjacent drive ratios achieved by a particular pair of front and rear clusters. </p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Input consists of several test cases, followed by a line containing 0.
