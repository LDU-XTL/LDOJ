</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In a rectangular 2D world everything is rectangular. Rectangular people live in rectangular houses, drive rectangular cars and work in rectangular offices. The only day of a year when everything is not rectangular is April 1st --- the Fool's Day. On that day people send each other postcards with jokes and these postcards have a form of parallelograms. To support this tradition the rectangular world industry produces different parallelogram postcards and envelopes. 
<br>Mr. Rect Squarowski wants to start a new business. He would like to provide a web service that determines whether a Fool's Day postcard fits Fool's Day envelope. Help Mr. Squarowski to earn his next billion of money rects. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains integer number n (1 <= n <= 1 000) --- the number of test cases. Each test case consists of six integer numbers. The first three numbers describe an envelope, the last three --- a postcard. 
<br>Three numbers describing each parallelogram are the lengths of its adjacent sides and its diagonal re-spectively. Specified lengths will not be greater than 1 000. 
<br>It is guaranteed that the corresponding parallelogram exists and it is not degenerate. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case output a single line. Print "Yes" if a postcard fits an envelope or "No" if it doesn't. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3
