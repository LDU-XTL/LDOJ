</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In this problem, you are given a list of words (sequence of lower case letters). From this list, find the longest chain of words w1, ..., wn such that wi is a mixed extension of w<sub>i-1</sub>. A word A is a mixed extension of another word B if A can be formed by adding one letter to B and permuting the result. For example, "ab", "bar", "crab", "cobra", and "carbon" form a chain of length 5. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains at least two, but no more than 10000 lines. Each line contains a word. The length of each word is at least 1 and no more than 20.
