</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Bill and Ted are taking a road trip. But the odometer in their car is broken, so they don't know how many miles they have driven. Fortunately, Bill has a working stopwatch, so they can record their speed and the total time they have driven. Unfortunately, their record keeping strategy is a little odd, so they need help computing the total distance driven. You are to write a program to do this computation. 
<br>
<br>For example, if their log shows
<br><blockquote><table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 border=1><tr><td>Speed in miles perhour<br></td><td>Total elapsed time in hours<br></td></tr><tr><td>20<br></td><td>2<br></td></tr><tr><td>30<br></td><td>6<br></td></tr><tr><td>10<br></td><td>7<br></td></tr></table></blockquote>
<br>this means they drove 2 hours at 20 miles per hour, then 6-2=4 hours at 30 miles per hour, then 7-6=1 hour at 10 miles per hour. The distance driven is then (2)(20) + (4)(30) + (1)(10) = 40 + 120 + 10 = 170 miles. Note that the total elapsed time is always since the beginning of the trip, not since the previous entry in their log. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of one or more data sets. Each set starts with a line containing an integer n, 1 <= n <= 10,  followed by n pairs of values, one pair per line. The first value in a pair, s, is the speed in miles per hour and the second value, t, is the total elapsed time. Both s and t are integers, 1 <= s <= 90 and 1 <= t <= 12.  The values for t are always in strictly increasing order. A value of -1 for n signals the end of the input.
