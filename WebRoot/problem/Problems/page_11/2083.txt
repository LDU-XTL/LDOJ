</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A fractal is an object or quantity that displays self-similarity, in a somewhat technical sense, on all scales. The object need not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, but the same "type" of structures must appear on all scales.
<br>A box fractal is defined as below :
<br><ul><li>A box fractal of degree 1 is simply
<br>X
<br><li> A box fractal of degree 2 is
<br>X X
<br>X
<br>X X
<br><li>If using B(n - 1) to represent the box fractal of degree n - 1, then a box fractal of degree n is defined recursively as following
<br><pre>B(n - 1)        B(n - 1)
<br>        B(n - 1)
<br>B(n - 1)        B(n - 1)</pre></ul>
<br>Your task is to draw a box fractal of degree n.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of several test cases. Each line of the input contains a positive integer n which is no greater than 7. The last line of input is a negative integer âˆ’1 indicating the end of input.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output the box fractal using the 'X' notation. Please notice that 'X' is an uppercase letter. Print a line with only a single dash after each test case.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">1
