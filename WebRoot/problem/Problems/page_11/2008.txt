</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">N (1 <= N <= 1,000) calves try out for the Moo U gymnastics team this year, each with a positive integer height and a weight less than 100,000.  Your goal is to select a team of as many calves as possible from this group. There is only one constraint the team must satisfy: the height H and weight W of each calf on the team must obey the following inequality:
<br><center>A*(H-h) + B*(W-w) <= C</center>
<br>where h and w are the minimum height and weight values over all calves on the team, and A, B and C are supplied positive integral constants less than 10,000.   Compute the maximum number of calves on the team.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1: A single integer, N
<br>
<br>* Line 2: Three space-separated integers, A, B and C
