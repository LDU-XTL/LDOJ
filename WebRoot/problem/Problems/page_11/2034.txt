</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Given a sequence of consecutive integers n,n+1,n+2,...,m, an anti-prime sequence is a rearrangement of these integers so that each adjacent pair of integers sums to a composite (non-prime) number. For example, if n = 1 and m = 10, one such anti-prime sequence is 1,3,5,4,2,6,9,7,8,10. This is also the lexicographically first such sequence.
<br>
<br>We can extend the definition by defining a degree danti-prime sequence as one where all consecutive subsequences of length 2,3,...,d sum to a composite number. The sequence above is a degree 2 anti-prime sequence, but not a degree 3, since the subsequence 5, 4, 2 sums to 11. The lexicographically .rst degree 3 anti-prime sequence for these numbers is 1,3,5,4,6,2,10,8,7,9.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input will consist of multiple input sets. Each set will consist of three integers, n, m, and d on a single line. The values of n, m and d will satisfy 1 <= n < m <= 1000, and 2 <= d <= 10.
