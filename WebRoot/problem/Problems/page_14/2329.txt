</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input is the matrix A of N by N non-negative integers.
<br>
<br>A distance between two elements A<sub>ij</sub> and A<sub>pq</sub> is defined as |i − p| + |j − q|.
<br>
<br>Your program must replace each zero element in the matrix with the nearest non-zero one. If there are two or more nearest non-zeroes, the zero must be left in place.
