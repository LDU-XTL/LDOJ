</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Stan and Ollie are playing a guessing game. Stan thinks of a number between 1 and 10 and Ollie guesses what the number might be. After each guess, Stan indicates whether Ollie's guess is too high, too low, or right on. 
<br>After playing several rounds, Ollie has become suspicious that Stan cheats; that is, that he changes the number between Ollie's guesses. To prepare his case against Stan, Ollie has recorded a transcript of several games. You are to determine whether or not each transcript proves that Stan is cheating. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Standard input consists of several transcripts. Each transcript consists of a number of paired guesses and responses. A guess is a line containing single integer between 1 and 10, and a response is a line containing "too high", "too low", or "right on". Each game ends with "right on". A line containing 0 follows the last transcript.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each game, output a line "Stan is dishonest" if Stan's responses are inconsistent with the final guess and response. Otherwise, print "Stan may be honest". </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">10
