</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The cows are going to space!  They plan to achieve orbit by building a sort of space elevator: a giant tower of blocks.  They have K (1 <= K <= 400) different types of blocks with which to build the tower.  Each block of type i has height h_i (1 <= h_i <= 100) and is available in quantity c_i (1 <= c_i <= 10).  Due to possible damage caused by cosmic rays, no part of a block of type i can exceed a maximum altitude a_i (1 <= a_i <= 40000).

<br>From the bottom: 3 blocks of type 2, below 3 of type 1, below 6 of type 3.  Stacking 4 blocks of type 2 and 3 of type 1 is not legal, since the top of the last type 1 block would exceed height 40.</div><p class="pst">
