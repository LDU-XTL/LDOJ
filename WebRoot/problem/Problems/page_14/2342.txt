It means that the supervisor relation forms a tree rooted at the rector V. E. Tretyakov. In order to make the party funny for every one, the rector does not want both an employee and his or her immediate supervisor to be present.

Your task is to make a list of guests with the maximal possible sum of guests' conviviality ratings.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Employees are numbered from 1 to N.
