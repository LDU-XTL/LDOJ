</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Due to recent rains, water has pooled in various places in Farmer John's field, which is represented by a rectangle of N x M (1 <= N <= 100; 1 <= M <= 100) squares. Each square contains either water ('W') or dry land ('.').  Farmer John would like to figure out how many ponds have formed in his field.  A pond is a connected set of squares with water in them, where a square is considered adjacent to all eight of its neighbors.
