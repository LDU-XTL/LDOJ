</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Mr. F. wants to get a document be signed by a minister. A minister signs a document only if it is approved by his ministry. The ministry is an M-floor building with floors numbered from 1 to M, 1<=M<=100. Each floor has N rooms (1<=N<=500) also numbered from 1 to N. In each room there is one (and only one) official. 
<br>
<br>A document is approved by the ministry only if it is signed by at least one official from the M-th floor. An official signs a document only if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied: 
<br><blockquote>a. the official works on the 1st floor; 
<br>b. the document is signed by the official working in the room with the same number but situated one floor below; 
<br>c. the document is signed by an official working in a neighbouring room (rooms are neighbouring if they are situated on the same floor and their numbers differ by one). </blockquote>
<br>Each official collects a fee for signing a document. The fee is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9. 
<br>
<br>You should find the cheapest way to approve the document.

<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of an input file contains two integers, separated by space. The first integer M represents the number of floors in the building, and the second integer N represents the number of rooms per floor. Each of the next M lines contains N integers separated with spaces that describe fees (the k-th integer at l-th line is the fee required by the official working in the k-th room at the l-th floor). </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">You should print the numbers of rooms (one per line) in the order they should be visited to approve the document in the cheapest way.
