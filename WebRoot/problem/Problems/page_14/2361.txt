</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Tic Tac Toe is a child's game played on a 3 by 3 grid. One player, X, starts by placing an X at an unoccupied grid position. Then the other player, O, places an O at an unoccupied grid position. Play alternates between X and O until the grid is filled or one player's symbols occupy an entire line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) in the grid. 
<br>We will denote the initial empty Tic Tac Toe grid with nine dots. Whenever X or O plays we fill in an X or an O in the appropriate position. The example below illustrates each grid configuration from the beginning to the end of a game in which X wins. 
<br><pre>...  X..  X.O  X.O  X.O  X.O  X.O  X.O
<br>...  ...  ...  ...  .O.  .O.  OO.  OO.
<br>...  ...  ...  ..X  ..X  X.X  X.X  XXX</pre>
<br>Your job is to read a grid and to determine whether or not it could possibly be part of a valid Tic Tac Toe game. That is, is there a series of plays that can yield this grid somewhere between the start and end of the game? </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains N, the number of test cases. 4N-1 lines follow, specifying N grid configurations separated by empty lines.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each case print "yes" or "no" on a line by itself, indicating whether or not the configuration could be part of a Tic Tac Toe game.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2
