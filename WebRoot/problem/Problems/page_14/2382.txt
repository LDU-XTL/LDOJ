In order to increase the auditorium, it were suggested to build several relay stations. N locations were selected as candidate sites for relay stations. Relay station placed in i-th location will cover a circular area with center in point (xi, yi) and radius ri, where center lies inside the area covered by the base station, (x0 - xi)<sup>2</sup> + (y0 - yi)<sup>2</sup> ≤ R<sup>2</sup>. 
<br>
<br>Your task is to select a subset of sites for relay stations so that: 
<br><ol><li>the covered areas for relays do not intersect (but may touch) one another, 
<br><li>the total area covered by base station and all relays is maximum possible. </ol></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input contains integer number N followed by real numbers x0 y0 R, followed by N triples of real numbers xi yi ri.
