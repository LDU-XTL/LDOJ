</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A catenym is a pair of words separated by a period such that the last letter of the first word is the same as the last letter of the second. For example, the following are catenyms: 
<br><pre>dog.gopher
<br>gopher.rat
<br>rat.tiger
<br>aloha.aloha
<br>arachnid.dog</pre>
<br>A compound catenym is a sequence of three or more words separated by periods such that each adjacent pair of words forms a catenym. For example, 
<br>
<br>aloha.aloha.arachnid.dog.gopher.rat.tiger
<br>
<br>Given a dictionary of lower case words, you are to find a compound catenym that contains each of the words exactly once.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of standard input contains t, the number of test cases.
