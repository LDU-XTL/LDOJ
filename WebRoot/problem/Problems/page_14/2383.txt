</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Graphics libraries usually implement drawing of graphics primitives, like lines, polygons and circles. Your task is to write a program that draws circles.
<br>
<br>Graphic canvas is represented as an array of X<sub>size</sub> by Y<sub>size</sub> pixels. Each pixel have a color ranged from 0 to 9. Initially all pixels have color 0. Pixels are thought of as small sqares with the side of length 1. A circle with center (xc, yc) and radius R is a set of pixels (x, y) satisfying the inequality (x − xc)<sup>2</sup> + (y − yc)<sup>2</sup> ≤ R<sup>2</sup>
<br>
<br>To draw a circle, your program should set the color of all pixels in a set defined above to the color of the circle. After drawing N given circles, the program should output the color of all pixels of the canvas.
