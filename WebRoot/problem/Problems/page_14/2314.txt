</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The problem wants you to understand a new programming language, POJ language, and ask you to calculate the result of a program, which is written in this language.
<br>
<br>The language may be described as follow (the integers mentioned here are in [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup>)):
<br><ol><li>The syntax of this language is similar with C language, but much more simple. And the different will be mentioned as below.
<br><li>The length of a program written in the language will not exceed 1000 letters.
<br><li>The variables need not declaration. If a variable is first mentioned, the value of the variable is set to be 0. And once a variable is mentioned, it will have a global scope. The length of the name of a variable will not exceed 5.
<br><li>A Boolean expression has the structures: "A&lt;B", "A==B" and "A<=B", here A is a variable or an integer, and so is B.
<br><li>There are three kind of normal expression I, II and III.
<br><li>The Normal expression I has one of the follow structures: "A=B;", "A=B+C;", "A=B-C;" and "A=B*C;", here A is an variable, B is an variable or a positive integer and C is also an variable or a positive integer. It's confirmed that the new value of A is also in [-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup>). And it's assumed that a program will execute these expressions at most 100000 times before terminated.
<br><li>In the language there is a new expression that is not defined in C language, and we consider this expression as normal expression II. The expression is as: "#A;", here A is a variable. This expression terminates the program and gives the result of the program, and it is the only way to terminate a program. And it's confirmed that during the processing of the program it must meet this expression.
<br><li>There are only two key words in the language, "if" and "while". There kinds of structures are considered as normal expression III.
<br><blockquote>a)	The "if" sentence is as: "if(a Boolean expression){some normal expressions}".
<br>b)	The "while" sentence is as: "while(a Boolean expression){some normal expressions}".</blockquote>
<br><li>There may be white spaces, which includes " ", "\t" and "\n", at any position except in key words, Boolean expressions, normal expressions I and normal expressions II.
<br><li>The program consists of some normal expressions.</ol>
