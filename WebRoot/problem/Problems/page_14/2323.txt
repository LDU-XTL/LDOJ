<br>Given a permutation a1, a2, a3,..., an of the n integers 1, 2, 3, ..., n, an inversion is a pair (ai, aj) where i < j and ai > aj. The number of inversions in a permutation gives an indication on how "unsorted" a permutation is. If we wish to analyze the average running time of a sorting algorithm, it is often useful to know how many permutations of n objects will have a certain number of inversions.
<br>
<br>In this problem you are asked to compute the number of permutations of n values that have exactly k inversions.
<br>
<br>For example, if n = 3, there are 6 permutations with the indicated inversions as follows:
<br><blockquote><pre>123			0 inversions
<br> 
<br>132			1 inversion (3 > 2)
<br> 
<br>213			1 inversion (2 > 1)
<br> 
<br>231			2 inversions (2 > 1, 3 > 1)
<br> 
<br>312			2 inversions (3 > 1, 3 > 2)
<br> 
<br>321			3 inversions (3 > 2, 3 > 1, 2 > 1)</pre></blockquote> 
<br>Therefore, for the permutations of 3 things
<br><ul><li>1 of them has 0 inversions 
<br><li>2 of them have 1 inversion 
<br><li>2 of them have 2 inversions 
<br><li>1 of them has 3 inversions 
<br><li>0 of them have 4 inversions 
<br><li>0 of them have 5 inversions 
<br><li>etc.</ul>
