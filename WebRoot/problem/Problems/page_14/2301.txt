In order to pass the time waiting for the half-time commercials and wardrobe malfunctions, the local hackers have organized a betting pool on the game. Members place their bets on the sum of the two final scores, or on the absolute difference between the two scores. 
<br>Given the winning numbers for each type of bet, can you deduce the final scores? 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of input contains n, the number of test cases. n lines follow, each representing a test case. Each test case gives s and d, non-negative integers representing the sum and (absolute) difference between the two final scores.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, output a line giving the two final scores, largest first. If there are no such scores, output a line containing "impossible". Recall that football scores are always non-negative integers.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2
