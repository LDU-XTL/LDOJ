</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">We say tree T1 is a top-bottom subtree of tree T if
<br>1. T1 is a tree and its nodes and edges are respectively the subsets of T’s nodes and edges, and
<br>2. w is node of tree T1 but not the root of T, then w’s parent is also in tree T1.

<br>We say two rooted unordered trees are isomorphic if
<br>1. a tree with a single node (the root) is only isomorphic to a tree with a single node;
<br>2. two trees with roots A and B, none of which is a single-node tree, are isomorphic iff there is a 1-1 correspondence between the subtrees of A and the subtrees of B such that corresponding subtrees are isomorphic.
<br><center><img src=images/2483_2.jpg></center>
<br>Given two rooted unordered trees, your task is to find out their top-bottom subtrees respectively which are isomorphic, and maximize the number of nodes of the subtrees, i.e., the Greatest Common Subtree.

Then m-1 lines follow, with two integers each line, indicating the label of the node and its parent in the second tree.
