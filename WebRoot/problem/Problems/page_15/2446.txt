</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Alice and Bob often play games on chessboard. One day, Alice draws a board with size M * N. She wants Bob to use a lot of cards with size 1 * 2 to cover the board. However, she thinks it too easy to bob, so she makes some holes on the board (as shown in the figure below). 
<br><center><img src=images/2446_1.jpg></center>
<br>We call a grid, which doesnâ€™t contain a hole, a normal grid. Bob has to follow the rules below:
<br>1. Any normal grid should be covered with exactly one card.
<br>2. One card should cover exactly 2 normal adjacent grids.
<br>
<br>Some examples are given in the figures below:
<br><center><img src=images/2446_2.jpg>
<br>A VALID solution.</center>
<br><center><img src=images/2446_3.jpg>
<br>An invalid solution, because the hole of red color is covered with a card.</center>
<br><center><img src=images/2446_4.jpg>
<br>An invalid solution, because there exists a grid, which is not covered.</center>
<br>Your task is to help Bob to decide whether or not the chessboard can be covered according to the rules above.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There are 3 integers in the first line: m, n, k (0 < m, n <= 32, 0 <= K < m * n), the number of rows, column and holes.
