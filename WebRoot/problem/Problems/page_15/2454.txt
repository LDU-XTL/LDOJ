</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In the newest census of Jersey Cows and Holstein Cows, Wisconsin cows have earned three stalls in the Barn of Representatives. The Jersey Cows currently control the state's redistricting committee. They want to partition the state into three equally sized voting districts such that the Jersey Cows are guaranteed to win elections in at least two of the districts.
<br>
<br>Wisconsin has 3*K (1 <= K <= 60) cities of 1,000 cows, numbered 1..3*K, each with a known number (range: 0..1,000) of Jersey Cows. Find a way to partition the state into three districts, each with K cities, such that the Jersey Cows have the majority percentage in at least two of districts.
