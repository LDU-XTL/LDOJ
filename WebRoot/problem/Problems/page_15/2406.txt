</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Given two strings a and b we define a*b to be their concatenation. For example, if a = "abc" and b = "def" then a*b = "abcdef". If we think of concatenation as multiplication, exponentiation by a non-negative integer is defined in the normal way: a^0 = "" (the empty string) and a^(n+1) = a*(a^n).</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each test case is a line of input representing s, a string of printable characters.
