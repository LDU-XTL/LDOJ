</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The Farey Sequence Fn for any integer n with n >= 2 is the set of irreducible rational numbers a/b with 0 < a < b <= n and gcd(a,b) = 1 arranged in increasing order. The first few are

<br>You task is to calculate the number of terms in the Farey sequence Fn.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There are several test cases. Each test case has only one line, which contains a positive integer n (2 <= n <= 10<sup>6</sup>). There are no blank lines between cases. A line with a single 0 terminates the input.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, you should output one line, which contains N(n) ---- the number of terms in the Farey sequence Fn.
