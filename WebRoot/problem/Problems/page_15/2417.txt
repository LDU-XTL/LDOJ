</pre><p class="pst">Hint</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The solution to this problem requires a well known result in number theory that is probably expected of you for Putnam but not ACM competitions. It is Fermat's theorem that states 
<br><pre>   B<sup>(P-1)</sup> == 1 (mod P)</pre>
<br>for any prime P and some other (fairly rare) numbers known as base-B pseudoprimes. A rarer subset of the base-B pseudoprimes, known as Carmichael numbers, are pseudoprimes for every base between 2 and P-1. A corollary to Fermat's theorem is that for any m
