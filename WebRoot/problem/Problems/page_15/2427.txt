<br>But one day Professor Smith met a strange problem. He had tried to find the positive solutions of the equation with the following form:
<br><center>X ^ 2 â€“ N * Y ^ 2 = 1,</center>
<br>in which N is a positive integer. But for many values of N, his poor computer seems cannot find an answer!
<br>
<br>"That's strange!" said Professor Smith "There must be something wrong with my program!" And you, the assistant of Professor Smith, are assigned the work to solve the problem.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will contain several test cases; each contains a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 10 ^ 8) in a single line.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, in a line output two positive integers X and Y that satisfy the equation and are smaller than 10 ^ 1000.
