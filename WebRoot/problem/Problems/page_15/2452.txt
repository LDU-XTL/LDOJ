</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Xuanxuan has n sticks of different length. One day, she puts all her sticks in a line, represented by S1, S2, S3, ...Sn. After measuring the length of each stick Sk (1 <= k <= n), she finds that for some sticks Si and Sj (1<= i < j <= n), each stick placed between Si and Sj is longer than Si but shorter than Sj.
<br>
<br>Now given the length of S1, S2, S3, â€¦Sn, you are required to find the maximum value j - i.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains multiple test cases. Each case contains two lines.
<br>Line 1: a single integer n (n <= 50000), indicating the number of sticks.
