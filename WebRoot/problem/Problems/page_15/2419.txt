</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">If a tree falls in the forest, and there's nobody there to hear, does it make a sound? This classic conundrum was coined by George Berkeley (1685-1753), the Bishop and influential Irish philosopher whose primary philosophical achievement is the advancement of what has come to be called subjective idealism. He wrote a number of works, of which the most widely-read are Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) and Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous (1713) (Philonous, the "lover of the mind," representing Berkeley himself). </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A forest contains T trees numbered from 1 to T and P people numbered from 1 to P. Standard input consists of a line containing P and T followed by several lines, containing a pair of integers i and j, indicating that person i has heard tree j fall.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">People may have different opinions as to which trees, according to Berkeley, have made a sound. Output how many different opinions are represented in the input? Two people hold the same opinion only if they hear exactly the same set of trees. You may assume that P < 100 and T < 100.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3 4
