The billionaire flymouse has offered him an opportunity to decorate all his houses and rooms. If the deal goes through, Sempr could spend rest of his life counting notes in his bed. However, large fortune never comes in ease. It turns out that Sempr is doing business with a man who is among the pickiest people in the world. Before his team starts working, flymouse has given him a long list of clauses, violation of any of which will mean &ldquo;deal&rsquo;s off&rdquo;.</p><p>In general, each clause in the list is about characteristics of several houses and/or rooms. Here&rsquo;s a possible clause among others:</p><ul><li>The roof of the villa in the mountain is not painted green,</li><li>or chandeliers are installed in the downtown office,</li><li>or the sea view apartment has a big window.</li></ul><p>A clause is always composed of one or more subclauses, connected by the conjunction <i>or</i> if necessary. It is satisfied as long as any of its subclauses is satisfied, whether the rest is satisfied or not. The same subclause can be found in more than one clauses and appear in both positive and negative forms.</p><p>Picky as he is, flymouse never creates the nonsense of &ldquo;mission impossible&rdquo;. List in hand, how will Sempr fulfil the deal before he can retire for life?</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The list of clauses is presented in multiple lines. The clauses are listed one after another, separated by lines containing a single word <tt>and</tt> if necessary. The subclauses of a clause each occupy a separate line. If a subclause is not the first subclause of a clause, it will be preceded by the word <tt>or</tt>, which is not part of it. A subclause consists of a sequence of words formed by lowercase letters in the English alphabet. A subclause is considered to be in positive form if it does not contain the word <tt>not</tt> and in negative form if the word <tt>not</tt> appears exactly one in it. The word <tt>not</tt> never appears more than once in a single subclause. If the word <tt>not</tt> is removed, the negative form of a subclause is exactly the same as its positive form. A clause has only one positive form but can have several negative forms, which are considered equivalent.</p><p>The list is non-empty and contains at most 1000 clauses, each consist of at least one and at most six subclauses. No subclauses are repeated in any forms in a single clause. There are at most 120 different subclauses if forms are neglected.</p><p>Words on the same line are separated by exactly one space. No lines contain any leading or trailing spaces and there are no blank lines.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>Show how Sempr meets flymouse&rsquo;s demands by telling which subclauses are satisfied and which are not.
