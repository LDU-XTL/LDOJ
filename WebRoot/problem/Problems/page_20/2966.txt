</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>There is a map of a minefield. The border of the minefield is a polygon which has not got self-intersections or self-contacts. There are two points <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> outside of this minefield or on its border. You need to find the minimum length way from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>. Obviously the way can not cross the minefield. However, it may contact edges or vertices of the bounding polygon.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input consists of several lines.

The second line contains integer number <b>N</b>, 3 &le; <b>N</b> &le; 100 &ndash; the number of vertices of the bounding polygon. Finally, each of the next N lines contains a coordinates <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> of one polygon vertex, in the counterclockwise order.
