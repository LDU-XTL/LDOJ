<br><p>Given a chessboard with the current situation, find the shortest number of moves such that the queen visits every knight and, finally, visits the bishop.</p><p>The queen visits by standing on one of the (at most) eight neighbouring squares and she does not necessarily have to move between two visits. For each move the queen can go an arbitrary number of squares in one of the eight directions (horizontal, vertical or diagonal). No move may pass through or stop at a non-empty square.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The first line contains the number of scenarios.
