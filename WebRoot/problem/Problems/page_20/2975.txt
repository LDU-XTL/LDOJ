Players alternate turns, and on his/her turn, a player&rsquo;s move consists of removing <i>one or more stones</i> from any single pile. Play ends when all the stones have been removed, at which point the last player to have moved is declared the winner. Given a position in Nim, your task is to determine how many winning moves there are in that position.</p><p>A position in Nim is called &ldquo;losing&rdquo; if the first player to move from that position would lose if both sides played perfectly. A &ldquo;winning move,&rdquo; then, is a move that leaves the game in a losing position. There is a famous theorem that classifies all losing positions. Suppose a Nim position contains <i>n</i> piles having <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <i>k<sub>n</sub></i> stones respectively; in such a position, there are <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> + &hellip; + <i>k<sub>n</sub></i> possible moves. We write each <i>k<sub>i</sub></i> in binary (base 2). Then, the Nim position is losing if and only if, among all the <i>k<sub>i</sub></i>&rsquo;s, there are an even number of 1&rsquo;s in each digit position. In other words, the Nim position is losing if and only if the <i>xor</i> of the <i>k<sub>i</sub></i>&rsquo;s is 0.</p><p>Consider the position with three piles given by <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> = 7, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> = 11, and <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> = 13. In binary, these values are as follows:</p><div align="center"><pre> 111<br>1011<br>1101<br> </pre></div><p>There are an odd number of 1&rsquo;s among the rightmost digits, so this position is not losing. However, suppose <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> were changed to be 12. Then, there would be exactly two 1&rsquo;s in each digit position, and thus, the Nim position would become losing. Since a winning move is any move that leaves the game in a losing position, it follows that removing one stone from the third pile is a winning move when <i>k</i><sub>1</sub> = 7, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub> = 11, and <i>k</i><sub>3</sub> = 13. In fact, there are exactly three winning moves from this position: namely removing one stone from any of the three piles.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input test file will contain multiple test cases, each of which begins with a line indicating the number of piles, 1 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 1000.
