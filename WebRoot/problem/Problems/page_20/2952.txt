For this problem, the <i>M</i> people are partitioned into <i>G</i> &ldquo;groups&rdquo; where all members within a group have the same voting preferences. The candidate preferences for a group are specified by listing candidates from most preferred to least preferred. Election results are determined by an <i>instant-runoff voting</i> procedure.</p><p>In this method, the first choices of the <i>M</i> people in the population are counted and the least popular candidate is eliminated. In the event of a tie, the highest-numbered candidate is eliminated. Then, the eliminated candidate is removed from the preference list of all <i>M</i> individuals in the population, and again the least popular candidate is eliminated. This process repeats until only a single candidate is left.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input test file will contain multiple test cases.
