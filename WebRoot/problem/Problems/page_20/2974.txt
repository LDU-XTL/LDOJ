</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>A 3-dimensional shape is said to be <i>convex</i> if the line segment joining any two points in the shape is entirely contained within the shape. Given a general set of points <i>X</i> in 3-dimensional space, the <i>convex hull</i> of <i>X</i> is the smallest convex shape containing all the points.</p><p>For example, consider <i>X</i> = {(0, 0, 0), (10, 0, 0), (0, 10, 0), (0, 0, 10)}. The convex hull of <i>X</i> is the tetrahedron with vertices given by <i>X</i>. Note that the tetrahedron contains the point (1, 1, 1), so even if this point were added to <i>X</i>, the convex hull would not change.</p><p>Given <i>X</i>, your task is to find the surface area of the convex hull of <i>X</i>, rounded to the nearest integer.</p><p>NOTE: The convex hull of any point set will have polygonal faces. For this problem, you may assume there will be at most 3 points in <i>X</i> on any face of the convex hull.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input test file will contain multiple test cases, each of which begins with an integer <i>n</i> (4 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 25) indicating the number of points in <i>X</i>.
