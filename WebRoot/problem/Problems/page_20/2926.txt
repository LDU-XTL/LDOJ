Of course, he has decided to do research in the most important domain: the requirements he must fulfill to graduate from his undergraduate university. First, he discovered (to his surprise) that he has to fulfill 5 distinct requirements: the general institute requirement, the writing requirement, the science requirement, the foreign-language requirement, and the field-of-specialization requirement. Formally, a requirement is a fixed number of classes that he has to take during his undergraduate years. Thus, for example, the foreign language requirement specifies that the student has to take 4 classes to fulfill this requirement: French I, French II, French III, and French IV. Having analyzed the immense multitude of the classes that need to be taken to fulfill the different requirements, our student became a little depressed about his undergraduate university: there are so many classes to take&hellip;</p><p>Dejected, the student began studying the requirements of other universities that he might have chosen after high school. He found that, in fact, other universities had exactly the same 5 requirements as his own university. The only difference was that different universities had different number of classes to be satisfied in each of the five requirement.</p><p>Still, it appeared that universities have pretty similar requirements (all of them require a lot of classes), so he hypothesized that no two universities are very dissimilar in their requirements. He defined the dissimilarity of two universities <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> as |<i>x</i><sub>1</sub> &minus; <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>| + |<i>x</i><sub>2</sub> &minus; <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>| + |<i>x</i><sub>3</sub> &minus; <i>y</i><sub>3</sub>| + |<i>x</i><sub>4</sub> &minus; <i>y</i><sub>4</sub>| + |<i>x</i><sub>5</sub> &minus; <i>y</i><sub>5</sub>|, where an <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>y<sub>i</sub></i>) is the number of classes in the requirement <i>i</i> of university <i>X</i> (<i>Y</i>) multiplied by an appropriate factor that measures hardness of the corresponding requirement at the corresponding university.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The first line of the input file contains an integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100 000), the number of considered universities.
