Because the number of cats is really huge, Newman wants to group some of the cats. To do that, he first offers a number to each of the cat (1, 2, 3, &hellip;, <i>n</i>). Then he occasionally combines the group cat <i>i</i> is in and the group cat <i>j</i> is in, thus creating a new group. On top of that, Newman wants to know the size of the <i>k</i>-th biggest group at any time.
