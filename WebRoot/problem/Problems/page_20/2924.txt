For those of you who remember the Deutsche Mark, a picture of him was printed on the 10 &ndash; DM bill. In elementary school, his teacher J. G. B&uuml;ttner tried to occupy the pupils by making them add up the integers from 1 to 100. The young Gau&szlig; surprised everybody by producing the correct answers (5050) within seconds.</p><p>Can you write a computer program that can compute such sums really quickly?</p><p>Given two integers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i>, you should compute the sum of all the integers from <i>n</i> to <i>m</i>.
