</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">While skimming his phone directory in 1982, Albert Wilansky, a mathematician of Lehigh University,noticed that the telephone number of his brother-in-law H. Smith had the following peculiar property: The sum of the digits of that number was equal to the sum of the digits of the prime factors of that number. Got it? Smith's telephone number was 493-7775. This number can be written as the product of its prime factors in the following way:
<br><center>4937775= 3*5*5*65837</center>
<br>The sum of all digits of the telephone number is 4+9+3+7+7+7+5= 42,and the sum of the digits of its prime factors is equally 3+5+5+6+5+8+3+7=42. Wilansky was so amazed by his discovery that he named this kind of numbers after his brother-in-law: Smith numbers.
<br>As this observation is also true for every prime number, Wilansky decided later that a (simple and unsophisticated) prime number is not worth being a Smith number, so he excluded them from the definition.
<br>Wilansky published an article about Smith numbers in the Two Year College Mathematics Journal and was able to present a whole collection of different Smith numbers: For example, 9985 is a Smith number and so is 6036. However,Wilansky was not able to find a Smith number that was larger than the telephone number of his brother-in-law. It is your task to find Smith numbers that are larger than 4937775!</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input file consists of a sequence of positive integers, one integer per line. Each integer will have at most 8 digits. The input is terminated by a line containing the number 0.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For every number n > 0 in the input, you are to compute the smallest Smith number which is larger than n,and print it on a line by itself.
