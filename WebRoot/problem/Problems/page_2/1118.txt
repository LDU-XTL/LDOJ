</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">"How am I ever going to solve this problem?" said the pilot. 
<br>
<br>Indeed, the pilot was not facing an easy task. She had to drop packages at specific points scattered in a dangerous area. Furthermore, the pilot could only fly over the area once in a straight line, and she had to fly over as many points as possible. All points were given by means of integer coordinates in a two-dimensional space. The pilot wanted to know the largest number of points from the given set that all lie on one line. Can you write a program that calculates this number? 
<br>
<br>
<br>Your program has to be efficient!
