<br>Figure 1 shows a square. Each row, each column and the two diagonals can be read as a five digit prime number. The rows are read from left to right. The columns are read from top to bottom. Both diagonals are read from left to right. Write a program that constructs such squares:
<br><ul>
<br><li>	The prime numbers must have the same digit sum (11 in the example). 
<br><li>	The digit in the top left-hand corner of the square is pre-determined (1 in the example). 
<br><li>	A prime number may be used more than once in the same square. 
<br><li>	If there are several solutions, all must be presented. 
<br><li>	A five digit prime number cannot begin with zeros, ie 00003 is NOT a five digit prime number. </ul>
