</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A bar-code symbol consists of alternating dark and light bars, starting with a dark bar on the left. Each bar is a number of units wide. Figure 1 shows a bar-code symbol consisting of 4 bars that extend over 1+2+3+1=7 units.

<br>
<br>In general, the bar code BC(n,k,m) is the set of all symbols with k bars that together extend over exactly n units, each bar being at most m units wide. For instance, the symbol in Figure 1 belongs to BC(7,4,3) but not to BC(7,4,2).

<br>Figure 2 shows all 16 symbols in BC(7,4,3). Each `1' represents a dark unit, each `0' a light unit. The symbols appear in lexicographic (dictionary) order. The number on the left of the colon (`:') is the rank of the symbol. The symbol in Figure 1 has rank 4 in BC(7,4,3).
