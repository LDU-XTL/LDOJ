</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">High up in the night sky, the shining stars appear in clusters of various shapes. A cluster is a non-empty group of neighbouring stars, adjacent in horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction. A cluster cannot be a part of a larger cluster.
<br>
<br>Clusters may be similar. Two clusters are similar if they have the same shape and number of stars, irrespective of their orientation. In general, the number of possible orientations for a cluster is eight, as Figure 1 exemplifies.

<br>The night sky is represented by a sky map, which is a two-dimensional matrix of 0's and 1's. A cell contains the digit 1 if it has a star, and the digit 0 otherwise.
<br>
<br>Given a sky map, mark all the clusters with lower case letters. Similar clusters must be marked with the same letter; non-similar clusters must be marked with different letters. You mark a cluster with a lower case letter by replacing every 1 in the cluster by that lower case letter. The order of allocation of letters depends on the first appearance of different clusters, from top to bottom and from left to right.
