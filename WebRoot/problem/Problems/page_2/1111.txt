</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Technicians in a pathology lab analyze digitized images of slides. Objects on a slide are selected for analysis by a mouse click on the object. The perimeter of the boundary of an object is one useful measure. Your task is to determine this perimeter for selected objects. 
<br>
<br>The digitized slides will be represented by a rectangular grid of periods, '.', indicating empty space, and the capital letter 'X', indicating part of an object.  Simple examples are 
<br><pre>
<br>XX   Grid 1       .XXX   Grid 2 
<br>XX                .XXX 
<br>                  .XXX 
<br>                  ...X 
<br>                  ..X. 
<br>                  X... </pre>
<br>An X in a grid square indicates that the entire grid square, including its boundaries, lies in some object.  The X in the center of the grid below is adjacent to the X in any of the 8 positions around it. The grid squares for any two adjacent X's overlap on an edge or corner, so they are connected. 
<br><pre>
<br>XXX 
<br>XXX    Central X and adjacent X's 
<br>XXX </pre>
<br>An object consists of the grid squares of all X's that can be linked to one another through a sequence of adjacent X's.  In Grid 1, the whole grid is filled by one object.  In Grid 2 there are two objects.  One object contains only the lower left grid square.  The remaining X's belong to the other object. 
<br>
<br>The technician will always click on an X, selecting the object containing that X.  The coordinates of the click are recorded.  Rows and columns are numbered starting from 1 in the upper left hand corner.  The technician could select the object in Grid 1 by clicking on row 2 and column 2.  The larger object in Grid 2 could be selected by clicking on row 2, column 3. The click could not be on row 4, column 3. 
<br><center><img src=images/1111/1111_1.gif></center>
<br> One useful statistic is the perimeter of the object.  Assume each X corresponds to a square one unit on each side.  Hence the object in Grid 1 has perimeter 8 (2 on each of four sides).  The perimeter for the larger object in Grid 2 is illustrated in the figure at the left.  The length is 18. 
<br>
<br>Objects will not contain any totally enclosed holes, so the leftmost grid patterns shown below could NOT appear. The variations on the right could appear:

Each grid is preceded by a line containing the number of rows and columns in the grid and the row and column of the mouse click.  All numbers are in the range 1-20.  The rows of the grid follow, starting on the next line, consisting of '.' and 'X' characters. 
<br>
<br>The end of the input is indicated by a line containing four zeros.  The numbers on any one line are separated by blanks.  The grid rows contain no blanks.
