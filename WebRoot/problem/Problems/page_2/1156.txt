</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The residents of Dingilville are trying to locate a region to build an airport. The map of the land is at hand. The map is a rectangular grid of unit squares, each identified by a pair of coordinates (x,y), where x is the horizontal (west-east) and y is the vertical (south-north) coordinate. The height of every square is shown on the map. 
<br>
<br>Your task is to find a rectangular region of squares with the largest area (i.e. a rectangular region consisting of the largest number of squares) such that 
<br>1.the height difference between the highest and the lowest squares of the region is less than or equal to a given limit C, and 
<br>2.the width (i.e. the number of squares along the west-east direction) of the region is at most 100.
<br>
<br>In case there is more than one such region you are required to report only one of them.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains three integers: U, V and C. 
<br>Each of the following V lines contains the integers Hxy for x = 1,...,U. More specifically, Hxy occurs as the x'th number on the (V-y+2)'th input line. 
<br>a.1 <= U <= 700, 1 <= V <= 700 where U and V designate the dimensions of the map. More specifically, U is the number of squares in the west-east direction, and V, in the south-north direction. 
<br>b.0 <= C <= 10
<br>c.-30,000 <= Hxy  <= 30,000 where the integer Hxy is the height of the square at coordinates (x, y), 1 <= x <= U, 1 <= y <= V.
<br>d.The southwest corner square of the map has the coordinates (1,1) and the northeast corner has the coordinates (U,V).</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output the largest area.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">10 15 4
