</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Fractions in octal (base 8) notation can be expressed exactly in decimal notation. For example, 0.75 in octal is 0.953125 (7/8 + 5/64) in decimal. All octal numbers of n digits to the right of the octal point can be expressed in no more than 3n decimal digits to the right of the decimal point.
