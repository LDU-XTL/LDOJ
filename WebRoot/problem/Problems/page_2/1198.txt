</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Solitaire is a game played on a chessboard 8x8. The rows and columns of the chessboard are numbered from 1 to 8, from the top to the bottom and from left to right respectively. 
<br>
<br>There are four identical pieces on the board. In one move it is allowed to: 
<br><ul>
<br><li>move a piece to an empty neighboring field (up, down, left or right), 
<br><li>jump over one neighboring piece to an empty field (up, down, left or right). 
<br></ul>
<br><center><img src=images/1198_1.jpg></center>
<br>There are 4 moves allowed for each piece in the configuration shown above. As an example let's consider a piece placed in the row 4, column 4. It can be moved one row up, two rows down, one column left or two columns right. 
<br>Write a program that: 
<br><ul>
<br><li>reads two chessboard configurations from the standard input, 
<br><li>verifies whether the second one is reachable from the first one in at most 8 moves, 
<br><li>writes the result to the standard output.
