<br>Figure 1 shows the map of a castle.Write a program that calculates
<br>1. how many rooms the castle has
<br>2. how big the largest room is
<br>The castle is divided into m * n (m<=50, n<=50) square modules. Each such module can have between zero and four walls. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Your program is to read from standard input. The first line contains the number of modules in the north-south direction and the number of modules in the east-west direction. In the following lines each module is described by a number (0 <= p <= 15). This number is the sum of: 1 (= wall to the west), 2 (= wall to the north), 4 (= wall to the east), 8 (= wall to the south). Inner walls are defined twice; a wall to the south in module 1,1 is also indicated as a wall to the north in module 2,1. The castle always has at least two rooms.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Your program is to write to standard output: First the number of rooms, then the area of the largest room (counted in modules).</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">4
