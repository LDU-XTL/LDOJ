So your task is to find the minimum number of borders that need to be crossed when traveling between two countries. We model the surface of Earth as a set of polygons in three dimensions forming a closed convex 3D shape, where each polygon corresponds to one country. You are not allowed to cross at points where more than two countries meet.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>Each test case consists of a line containing <i>c</i>, the number of countries (4 &le; <i>c</i> &le; 6000), followed by <i>c</i> lines containing the integers <i>n</i> <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> <i>y</i><sub>1</sub> <i>z</i><sub>1</sub> &hellip; <i>x<sub>n</sub> y<sub>n</sub> z<sub>n</sub></i>, describing (in order) the n corners of a closed polygon (3 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 20). Then follows a line with one integer <i>m</i> (0 &lt; <i>m</i> &le; 50), and then m lines with queries <i>c<sub>a</sub> c<sub>b</sub></i>, where <i>c<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>c<sub>b</sub></i> are country numbers (starting with 1). No point will be on the line between two connected points, and &minus;10<sup>6</sup> &le; <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> &le; 10<sup>6</sup> for all points. No two non-adjacent edges of a country share a common point. The input is terminated by a case where <i>c</i> = 0, which should not be processed.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each query, output the number of borders you must cross to go from <i>c<sub>a</sub></i> to <i>c<sub>b</sub></i>.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">6
