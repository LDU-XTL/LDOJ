Finally, the only 2-pair of ZGBG is ZG, so ZGBG is 2-unique. Thus ZGBG is surprising. (Note that the fact that ZG is both a 0-pair and a 2-pair of ZGBG is irrelevant, because 0 and 2 are different distances.)</p><p><b>Acknowledgement:</b> This problem is inspired by the &quot;Puzzling Adventures&quot; column in the December 2003 issue of <i>Scientific American</i>.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of one or more nonempty strings of at most 79 uppercase letters, each string on a line by itself, followed by a line containing only an asterisk that signals the end of the input.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each string of letters, output whether or not it is surprising using the exact output format shown below.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">ZGBG
