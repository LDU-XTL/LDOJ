</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Numerous are the moments I as a programmer have been frustrated by the tedious conversions between decimal numbers and hexadecimal ones. Why have we chosen 10 as a base in our everyday numerical presentations, when 16 seems so practically appealing? Obviously because everyone is not the computer geek I am. Maybe some day the world will fully realise the benefits of the hexadecimal system. In the meantime I have to learn to master the base conversions since most of the time numbers do not resemble one another in different bases.
<br>
<br>Sometimes peculiar relationships emerge among the different base representations of numbers though. For instance, I noticed just the other day that 1040<sub>10</sub> * 4 = 1040<sub>16</sub>, i.e. (1*10<sup>3</sup>+0*10<sup>2</sup>+4*10<sup>1</sup>+0*10<sup>0</sup>)*4=(1*16<sup>3</sup>+0*16<sup>2</sup>+4*16<sup>1</sup>+0*16<sup>0</sup>). It made me wonder how often this is the case, that is, the digits of a number in one base, are exactly the same as the digits of a multiple of the number in another base. Formally, let B1 < B2 be positive integers, and a0,a1,…,ak be integers in [0…B1-1]. For which ai’s is there a positive integer c such that

Each test case is on a line of its own and consists of two integer bases B1, B2, 9 <= B1 < B2 <= 100, and two integer range elements, r1, and r2, 0 < r1 < r2 <= 10000. Notice that all numbers in the input are given in the base 10.

If no such integer i exists, output the text ‘Non-existent.’.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">4
