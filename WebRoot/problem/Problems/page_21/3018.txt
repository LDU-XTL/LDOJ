So Bobobo is considering preparing Bottle an unexpected gift for his birthday. As a common sense that when a person at his or her birthday party, he or she will open the gift with the presence of the person who gives the gift and then expresses the appreciation. Bobobo knows that the characteristic of Bottle is rush when he receives something important, so he wants to play a joke on him in this way&hellip;</p><p>Bobobo comes into a gift shop, and there are a lot of different kinds of gift boxes. Bobobo intends to choose various boxes with different size and choose one of the gift boxes to contain the precious gift and place this box into another bigger box and place this bigger box into another bigger one&hellip; So Bottle will not see the gift until he opens the innermost box. Imagine the process of his opening the boxes, how rush Bottle will be ^_^ !</p><p>The gift boxes are <i>n</i>-dimensional. An <i>n</i>-dimensional box with dimensions ( <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <i>X<sub>n</sub></i> ) can be put into another box with dimensions ( <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <i>Y<sub>n</sub></i> ) if there exists a permutation <i>&pi;</i> on { 1, 2, &hellip;, <i>n</i> } such that <i>X<sub>&pi;</sub></i><sub><span style="vertical-align: sub">1</span></sub> &lt; <i>Y</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>X<sub>&pi;</sub></i><sub><span style="vertical-align: sub">2</span></sub> &lt; <i>Y</i><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <i>X<sub>&pi;</sub></i><sub><span style="vertical-align: sub; font-style: italic">n</span></sub> &lt; <i>Y<sub>n</sub></i>. The gift is also <i>n</i>-dimensional and it can be put into a box if it satisfies the criterion above. And Bobobo must try his best to choose as many as boxes to contain the gift.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input file contains multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains two numbers. The first one is a positive integer number <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 500), the number of boxes in the gift shop, and the second one is a positive number <i>d</i> (3 &le; <i>d</i> &le; 1 000), the dimension of all the boxes. The next one line contains <i>d</i> positive integers ( <i>G</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>G</i><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <i>G<sub>d</sub></i> ) representing the dimensions of the gift. And the subsequent <i>N</i> lines each contain <i>d</i> positive integers ( <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <i>X<sub>d</sub></i> ) representing the dimensions of each box. You may assume that all the numbers you encounter are positive integers and less than 2<sup>31</sup>.
