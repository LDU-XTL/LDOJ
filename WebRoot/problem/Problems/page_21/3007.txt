</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>RJ Freight, a Japanese railroad company for freight operations has recently constructed exchange lines at Hazawa, Yokohama. The layout of the lines is shown in Figure 1.</p><p align="center"><img src=images/3007_1.gif border=1><br>Figure 1: Layout of the exchange lines</p><p>A freight train consists of 2 to 72 freight cars. There are 26 types of freight cars, which are denoted by 26 lowercase letters from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;z&quot;. The cars of the same type are indistinguishable from each other, and each car's direction doesn't matter either. Thus, a string of lowercase letters of length 2 to 72 is sufficient to completely express the configuration of a train.</p><p>Upon arrival at the exchange lines, a train is divided into two sub-trains at an arbitrary position (prior to entering the storage lines). Each of the sub-trains may have its direction reversed (using the reversal line). Finally, the two sub-trains are connected in either order to form the final configuration. Note that the reversal operation is optional for each of the sub-trains.</p><p>For example, if the arrival configuration is &quot;abcd&quot;, the train is split into two sub-trains of either 3:1, 2:2 or 1:3 cars. For each of the splitting, possible final configurations are as follows (&quot;+&quot; indicates final concatenation position):</p><pre>  [3:1]<br>    abc+d  cba+d  d+abc  d+cba<br>  [2:2]<br>    ab+cd  ab+dc  ba+cd  ba+dc  cd+ab  cd+ba  dc+ab  dc+ba<br>  [1:3]<br>    a+bcd  a+dcb  bcd+a  dcb+a</pre><p>Excluding duplicates, 12 distinct configurations are possible.</p><p>Given an arrival configuration, answer the number of distinct configurations which can be constructed using the exchange lines described above.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The entire input looks like the following.</p><blockquote><p><i>the number of datasets = m</i><br><i>1st dataset</i> <br><i>2nd dataset</i> <br>... <br><i>m-th dataset</i></p></blockquote><p>Each dataset represents an arriving train, and is a string of 2 to 72 lowercase letters in an input line.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>For each dataset, output the number of possible train configurations in a line.
