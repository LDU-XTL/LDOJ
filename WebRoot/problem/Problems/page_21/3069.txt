To keep track of his forces, Saruman distributes seeing stones, known as palantirs, among the troops. Each palantir has a maximum effective range of <i>R</i> units, and must be carried by some troop in the army (i.e., palantirs are not allowed to &ldquo;free float&rdquo; in mid-air). Help Saruman take control of Middle Earth by determining the minimum number of palantirs needed for Saruman to ensure that each of his minions is within <i>R</i> units of some palantir.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input test file will contain multiple cases.
