A push button door lock consists of a number of push buttons <i><b>B</b></i>, (1 &le; <i><b>B</b></i> &le; 11), labeled &ldquo;1&rdquo; through &ldquo;<i><b>B</b></i>&rdquo;. The lock is opened by pressing the correct sequence of button combinations and then turning the doorknob. If the sequence of presses is correct, the door magically opens.</p><p>A combination consists of 1 or more buttons being pressed simultaneously. A sequence consists of a series of combinations. A sequence must have at least one combination. Once a button has been used in a combination, it may not be used again in the same sequence. In addition, it is not necessary to use all the buttons in a sequence. For example, for <i><b>B</b></i> = 8:</p><p align="center">(1-2-3)(4)(7-8)</p><p>is a valid sequence with 3 combinations (1-2-3), (4), and (7-8). Note that buttons 5 and 6 are not used in this sequence.</p><p align="center">(1-2-3)(2-4)(5-6)</p><p>is not a valid sequence, since button 2 appears in 2 combinations (1-2-3) and (2-4).</p><p>The CEO of Frobozz, <i>J. Pierpont Flathead</i>, wants you to write a program that determines the number of valid sequences possible for given values of <i><b>B</b></i>. The program must be able to process a list of lock orders (datasets) from customers and generate a report showing the order number, the value of <i><b>B</b></i>, and the number of valid sequences possible. This list will always contain at least one dataset, but no more than 100 datasets.</p><p>Reference Materials:</p><p align="center"><img src=images/3088_1.gif><br>J.
