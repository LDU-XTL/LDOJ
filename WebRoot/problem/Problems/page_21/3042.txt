</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A long, linear field has N (1 <= N <= 1,000) clumps of grass at unique integer locations on what will be treated as a number line.Think of the clumps as points on the number line.
<br>
<br>Bessie starts at some specified integer location L on the number line (1 <= L <= 1,000,000) and traverses the number line in the two possible directions (sometimes reversing her direction) in order to reach and eat all the clumps.  She moves at a constant speed (one unit of distance in one unit of time), and eats a clump instantly when she encounters it.
<br>
<br>Clumps that aren't eaten for a while get stale.  We say the "staleness" of a clump is the amount of time that elapses from when Bessie starts moving until she eats a clump.  Bessie wants to minimize the total staleness of all the clumps she eats.
<br>
<br>Find the minimum total staleness that Bessie can achieve while eating all the clumps.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">* Line 1 : Two space-separated integers: N and L.
