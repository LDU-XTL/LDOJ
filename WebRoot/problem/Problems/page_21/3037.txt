</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Bessie and the rest of Farmer John's cows are taking a trip this winter to go skiing.  One day Bessie finds herself at the top left corner of an R (1 <= R <= 100) by C (1 <= C <= 100) grid of elevations E (-25 <= E <= 25). In order to join FJ and the other cows at a discow party, she must get down to the bottom right corner as quickly as she can by travelling only north, south, east, and west.
<br>
<br>Bessie starts out travelling at a initial speed V (1 <= V <= 1,000,000).  She has discovered a remarkable relationship between her speed and her elevation change.  When Bessie moves from a location of height A to an adjacent location of eight B, her speed is multiplied by the number 2^(A-B).  The time it takes Bessie to travel from a location to an adjacent location is the reciprocal of her speed when she is at the first location.
<br>
<br>Find the both smallest amount of time it will take Bessie to join her cow friends.
