Suby the loyal civilian in KCM city is preparing a big neat Christmas tree. The simple structure of the tree is shown in right picture.</p><p>The tree can be represented as a collection of numbered nodes and some edges. The nodes are numbered 1 through <i>n</i>. The root is always numbered 1. Every node in the tree has its weight. The weights can be different from each other. Also the shape of every available edge between two nodes is different, so the unit price of each edge is different. Because of a technical difficulty, price of an edge will be (sum of weights of all descendant nodes) &times; (unit price of the edge).</p><p>Suby wants to minimize the cost of whole tree among all possible choices. Also he wants to use all nodes because he wants a large tree. So he decided to ask you for helping solve this task by find the minimum cost.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input consists of <i>T</i> test cases.
