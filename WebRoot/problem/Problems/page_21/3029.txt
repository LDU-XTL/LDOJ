You let them have a lunch break where they could do whatever they like. Now you have to get them back to the bus, but they are all walking in random directions. You try to intersect them, and send them straight back to the bus. Minimize the time before the last person is in the bus. You will always be able to run faster than any of the tour guests, and they walk with constant speed, no matter what you tell them. The seniors walk in straight lines, and the only way of changing their direction is to give them promises of camphor candy. A senior will neither stop at nor enter the bus before given such a promise.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>A number of test cases consisting of: A line with an integer 1 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 8, the number of people on the tour. A line with an floating point number 1 &lt; <i>v</i> &le; 100, your maximum speed (you start in the bus at the origin).
