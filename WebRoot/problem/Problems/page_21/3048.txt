</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">To improve the organization of his farm, Farmer John labels each of his N (1 <= N <= 5,000) cows with a distinct serial number in the range 1..20,000.  Unfortunately, he is unaware that the cows interpret some serial numbers as better than others.  In particular, a cow whose serial number has the highest prime factor enjoys the highest social standing among all the other cows.

<br>(Recall that a prime number is just a number that has no divisors except for 1 and itself.  The number 7 is prime while the number 6, being divisible by 2 and 3, is not).
