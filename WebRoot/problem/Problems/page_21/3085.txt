The people he hires (usually high school kids) often make mistakes making change for the customers. Flathead, who&rsquo;s a bit of a tightwad, figures he loses more money from these mistakes than he makes; that is, the employees tend to give more change to the customers than they should get. </p><p>Flathead wants you to write a program that calculates the number of quarters ($0.25), dimes ($0.10), nickels ($0.05) and pennies ($0.01) that the customer should get back. Flathead always wants to give the customer&rsquo;s change in coins if the amount due back is $5.00 or under. He also wants to give the customers back the smallest total number of coins. For example, if the change due back is $1.24, the customer should receive 4 quarters, 2 dimes, 0 nickels, and 4 pennies.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The first line of input contains an integer <i><b>N </b></i>which is the number of datasets that follow.
