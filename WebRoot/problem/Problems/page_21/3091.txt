For example, in the array in Figure 1, a queen on the black cell, attacks all of the shaded cells. The Triangular N-Queens Problem of size <i><b>N</b></i>, is to find a maximal set of queen positions in a triangular array with <i><b>N</b></i> cells on a side so that no queen is attacking any other queen. For example, the black cells in Figure 2 give a maximal set of queen positions in a size 6 array. It turns out that a size <i><b>N</b></i> array always has <i><b>floor</b></i>((2 * <i><b>N</b></i> + 1) &frasl; 3) as the maximal number of non-attacking queen positions.</p><center><img src=images/3091_1.png></center><p>Write a program, which, given the size, <i><b>N</b></i>, of the triangular array, finds a maximal set of non-attacking queen positions on the array (<i><b>floor</b></i>((2 * <i><b>N</b></i> + 1) &frasl; 3) of them).</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input begins with a line containing an integer value specifying the number of datasets that follow, <i><b>C</b></i> (1 &le; <i><b>C</b></i> &le; 1000).

Following the first line will be the queen positions, 8 positions per line except perhaps for the last line of positions. Each position has the format open bracket (&lsquo;[&rsquo;), row number starting with 1, a comma, the position from the left within the row starting at 1 and a close bracket (&lsquo;]&rsquo;). Positions within a line are separated by a single space. For example, the queen positions in Figure 2 are [1,1] [4,2] [5,4] [6,3]. The lines of position values are followed by a single blank line.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">6
