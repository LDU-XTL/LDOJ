Harmony &mdash; the stage of society so many people dream of and yet it seems so far away from now&hellip;</p><p>Fortunately, the method of unlocking the key to true Harmony is just discovered by a group of philosophers. It is recorded on a strange meteorite which has just hit the earth. You need to decipher the true meaning behind those seemingly random symbols&hellip; More precisely, you are to write a program which will support the following two kinds of operation on an initially empty set <i>S</i>:</p><ol><li><i>B X</i>: Add number <i>X</i> to set <i>S</i>. The <i>K</i><sup>th</sup> command in the form of <i>B X</i> always happens at time <i>K</i>, and number <i>X</i> does not belong to set <i>S</i> before this operation.</li><li><i>A Y</i> : Of all the numbers in set <i>S</i> currently, find the one which has the minimum remainder when divided by <i>Y</i>. In case a tie occurs, you should choose the one which appeared latest in the input. Report the time when this element is inserted.</li></ol><p>It is said that if the answer can be given in the minimum possible time, true Harmony can be achieved by human races. You task is to write a program to help us.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>There are multiple test cases in the input file.
