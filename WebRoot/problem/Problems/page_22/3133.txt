</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>There is a rectangular area containing <i>n</i> &times; <i>m</i> cells. Two cells are marked with &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and another two with &ldquo;3&rdquo;. Some cells are occupied by obstacles. You should connect the two &ldquo;2&rdquo;s and also the two &ldquo;3&rdquo;s with non-intersecting lines. Lines can run only vertically or horizontally connecting centers of cells without obstacles.</p><p>Lines cannot run on a cell with an obstacle. Only one line can run on a cell at most once. Hence, a line cannot intersect with the other line, nor with itself. Under these constraints, the total length of the two lines should be minimized. The length of a line is defined as the number of cell borders it passes. In particular, a line connecting cells sharing their border has length 1.</p><p>Fig. 1(a) shows an example setting.
