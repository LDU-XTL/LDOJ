</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>In the country of Byterland, cities are laid out along the shore of a beautiful river that flows from north to south. The northernmost city is labeled number 1, the city directly to its south is labeled number 2, etc. During the summer, ships are only allowed to travel south, or stay where they are, due to the huge number of tourists. There is always a route from each city <i>i</i> to city <i>i</i> + 1. Additional routes between cities may also exist, including possibly routes between a city and itself.</p><p>Three people are planning to take journeys down the river, and they would like to coordinate their travel plans in order to minimize their total cost. Each person has their own individual starting and ending cities. The cost of traveling on any single ship route is always 1 dollar. If two or three people take the same route together as a group, the total ticket price is 1 dollar for the whole group. Please calculate the minimum total cost paid by the trio of travelers.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>On the first line of the input you will be given an integer <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 1000) representing the number of cities, and an integer <i>M</i> (<i>M</i> &le; 10000) representing the number of routes to be given below (excluding the mandatory routes from each city <i>i</i> to city <i>i</i> + 1).</p><p>The following <i>M</i> pairs of integers each contain a piece of information for a single route, in the form of &ldquo;<i>A</i> <i>B</i>&rdquo; where <i>A</i> indicates the starting city of this route and <i>B</i> shows the ending city.
