There are <i>N</i> planet systems, numbered from 0 to <i>N</i> &minus; 1, and some of them are connected by one-way hyperspace tunnels. Some hyperspace tunnels are passable at all times, while others are only available at certain times. Initially you are at the ice planet <i>Hoth</i>, the system numbered 0, at time 0 and you need to get to <i>Sullust</i>, the system numbered <i>N</i> &minus; 1. Since there are <i>K</i> Imperial Star Destroyers following you, and they will also make the jump into the hyperspace to continue the pursuit, you have decided to use the <i>K</i> + 1<sup>th</sup> shortest path from <i>Hoth</i> to <i>Sullust</i> so as to minimize the possibility of being attacked halfway by Imperial starships; furthermore, in order to avoid detection, you do not want to risk staying at a system longer than <i>T</i> seconds.</p><p>Note that multiple shortest paths may require same travel time, and your travel path may not be simple (i.e. you are allowed to visit some systems and use some hyperspace tunnels more than once during your journey).</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>There are multiple test cases in the input file.
