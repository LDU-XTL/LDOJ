</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Farmer John has N (1 <= N <= 25,000) rectangular barns on his farm, all with sides parallel to the X and Y axes and integer corner coordinates in the range 0..1,000,000. These barns do not overlap although they may share corners and/or sides with other barns.
<br>
<br>Since he has extra cows to milk this year, FJ would like to expand some of his barns.  A barn has room to expand if it does not share a corner or a wall with any other barn.  That is, FJ can expand a barn if all four of its walls can be pushed outward by at least some amount without bumping into another barn.  If two barns meet at a corner, neither barn can expand.
<br>
<br>Please determine how many barns have room to expand.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single integer, N

<br>There are 5 barns.  The first barn has its lower-left corner at (0,2) and its upper-right corner at (2,7), and so on.
