</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">FJ and his cows enjoy playing a mental game. They write down the numbers from 1 to N (1 <= N <= 10) in a certain order and then sum adjacent numbers to produce a new list with one fewer number.  They repeat this until only a single number is left.  For example, one instance of the game (when N=4) might go like this:
<br>
<br><pre>    3   1   2   4
<br>      4   3   6
<br>        7   9
<br>         16</pre>Behind FJ's back, the cows have started playing a more difficult game, in which they try to determine the starting sequence from only the final total and the number N.  Unfortunately, the game is a bit above FJ's mental arithmetic capabilities.
<br>
<br>Write a program to help FJ play the game and keep up with the cows.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and the final sum.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: An ordering of the integers 1..N that leads to the given sum.
