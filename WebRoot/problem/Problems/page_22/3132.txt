</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>A positive integer may be expressed as a sum of different prime numbers (primes), in one way or another. Given two positive integers <i>n</i> and <i>k</i>, you should count the number of ways to express <i>n</i> as a sum of <i>k</i> different primes. Here, two ways are considered to be the same if they sum up the same set of the primes. For example, 8 can be expressed as 3 + 5 and 5 + 3 but the are not distinguished.</p><p>When <i>n</i> and <i>k</i> are 24 and 3 respectively, the answer is two because there are two sets {2, 3, 19} and {2, 5, 17} whose sums are equal to 24. There are not other sets of three primes that sum up to 24. For <i>n</i> = 24 and <i>k</i> = 2, the answer is three, because there are three sets {5, 19}, {7, 17} and {11, 13}. For <i>n</i> = 2 and <i>k</i> = 1, the answer is one, because there is only one set {2} whose sum is 2. For <i>n</i> = 1 and <i>k</i> = 1, the answer is zero. As 1 is not a prime, you shouldn&rsquo;t count {1}. For <i>n</i> = 4 and <i>k</i> = 2, the answer is zero, because there are no sets of two different primes whose sums are 4.</p><p>Your job is to write a program that reports the number of such ways for the given <i>n</i> and <i>k</i>.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input is a sequence of datasets followed by a line containing two zeros separated by a space.
