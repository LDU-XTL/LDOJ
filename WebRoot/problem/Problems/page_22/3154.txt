The ACM encircles a green park, and holds the holographic statues of famous contestants placed equidistantly along the park perimeter. The alley has to be renewed from time to time when a new group of memorials arrives.</p><p>When new memorials are added, the exact place for each can be selected arbitrarily along the ACM, but the equidistant disposition must be maintained by moving some of the old statues along the alley.</p><p>Surprisingly, humans are still quite superstitious in 24th century: the graveyard keepers believe the holograms are holding dead people souls, and thus always try to renew the ACM with minimal possible movements of existing statues (besides, the holographic equipment is very heavy). Statues are moved along the park perimeter. Your work is to find a renewal plan which minimizes the sum of travel distances of all statues. Installation of a new hologram adds no distance penalty, so choose the places for newcomers wisely!</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>Input file contains two integer numbers: <i>n</i> &mdash; the number of holographic statues initially located at the ACM, and <i>m</i> &mdash; the number of statues to be added (2 &le; <i>n</i> &le; 1000, 1 &le; <i>m</i> &le; 1000).
