</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Oh those picky N (1 <= N <= 50,000) cows! They are so picky that each one will only be milked over some precise time interval A..B (1 <= A <= B <= 1,000,000), which includes both times A and B.  Obviously, FJ must create a reservation system to determine which stall each cow can be assigned for her milking time. Of course, no cow will share such a private moment with other cows.
<br>
<br>Help FJ by determining:<ul><li>The minimum number of stalls required in the barn so that each cow can have her private milking period</li><li>An assignment of cows to these stalls over time</li></ul>Many answers are correct for each test dataset; a program will grade your answer.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single integer, N
