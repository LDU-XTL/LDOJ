</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">FJ has purchased N (1 <= N <= 2000) yummy treats for the cows who get money for giving vast amounts of milk. FJ sells one treat per day and wants to maximize the money he receives over a given period time.
<br>
<br>The treats are interesting for many reasons:<ul><li>The treats are numbered 1..N and stored sequentially in single file in a long box that is open at both ends. On any day, FJ can retrieve one treat from either end of his stash of treats.</li><li>Like fine wines and delicious cheeses, the treats improve with age and command greater prices.</li><li>The treats are not uniform: some are better and have higher intrinsic value. Treat i has value v(i) (1 <= v(i) <= 1000).</li><li>Cows pay more for treats that have aged longer: a cow will pay v(i)*a for a treat of age a.</li></ul>Given the values v(i) of each of the treats lined up in order of the index i in their box, what is the greatest value FJ can receive for them if he orders their sale optimally?
<br>
<br>The first treat is sold on day 1 and has age a=1. Each subsequent day increases the age by 1.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single integer, N

<br>
<br>Five treats. On the first day FJ can sell either treat #1 (value 1) or treat #5 (value 2).
<br>
<br>FJ sells the treats (values 1, 3, 1, 5, 2) in the following order of indices: 1, 5, 2, 3, 4, making 1x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + 4x1 + 5x5 = 43.</div><p class="pst">
