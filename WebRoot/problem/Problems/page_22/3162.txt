Chasing after the championship in an important competition, she comes to a training center to attend a training course. The center has <i>N</i> check-points numbered 1 through <i>N</i>. Some pairs of check-points are directly connected by two-way paths. The check-points and the paths form exactly a tree-like structure. The course lasts <i>N</i> days. On the <i>i</i>-th day, wc picks check-point <i>i</i> as the starting point and chooses another check-point as the finishing point and walks along the only simple path between the two points for the day&rsquo;s training. Her choice of finishing point will make it that the resulting path will be the longest among those of all possible choices.</p><p>After every day&rsquo;s training, flymouse will do a physical examination from which data will obtained and analyzed to help wc&rsquo;s future training be better instructed. In order to make the results reliable, flymouse is not using data all from <i>N</i> days for analysis. flymouse&rsquo;s model for analysis requires data from a series of consecutive days during which the difference between the longest and the shortest distances wc walks cannot exceed a bound <i>M</i>. The longer the series is, the more accurate the results are. flymouse wants to know the number of days in such a longest series. Can you do the job for him?</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains a single test case.

Then follow <i>N</i> &minus; 1 lines, each containing two integers <i>f<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>i</sub></i> (i = 1, 2, &hellip;, <i>N</i> &minus; 1), meaning the check-points <i>i</i> + 1 and <i>f<sub>i</sub></i> are connected by a path of length <i>d<sub>i</sub></i>.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Output one line with only the desired number of days in the longest series.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3 2

Two paths of lengths 1 and 3 connect check-points 2 and 3 to check-point 1. The three paths along with wc walks are 1-3, 2-1-3 and 3-1-2. And their lengths are 3, 4 and 4. Therefore data from all three days can be used for analysis.</p></div><p class="pst">
