Recently, some old Babylonian tablets were found. They described details of the roulette game.</p><p>In modern terms, the rules of the game were as follows:</p><ul><li>Roulette&rsquo;s compartments had only six labels: <code>-1, -2, -3, 1, 2, 3</code>.</li><li>The game was played by turns, during a day. Turns were numerated <code>0, 1, 2, ...</code></li><li>Players could win or lose a multiple of the <i>bet</i>, a quantity of money that was constant along the day.</li><li>At turn <i>t</i> there was an amount of money <i>P<sub>t</sub></i>, called the <i>pot</i>.</li><li>At the start, there was an initial amount of money <i>P</i><sub>0</sub> in the pot.</li><li><i>P</i><sub>0</sub> and the bet were positive numbers arbitrarily defined by the King.</li><li>In a turn, a player turned the roulette. A player could not play more than once in a day. Depending on the compartment where the ball came to rest, the player won (or lose, if the value was negative) an mount <i>w<sub>t</sub></i> = <i>L</i> * <i>bet</i> of money, where <i>L</i> corresponded to the compartment&rsquo;s label.</li><li>The won money was taken from the pot (or put in it if the player lose), i.e. the value of the pot in a given turn was determined by <i>P<sub>t</sub></i><sub>+1</sub> = <i>P<sub>t</sub></i> + <i>w<sub>t</sub></i>.</li>  <li>If as a result of the last rule <i>P<sub>t</sub></i><sub>+1</sub> was a negative number the winner won only the maximum multiple of the bet that he could win without making a negative pot.</li><li>If at some turn the pot was less than the bet, the game was ended for that day. If that was not the case the game continued till sunset.</li></ul><p>Beside the tablets that explained the rules some other tablets were found. These had lines with three numbers. Archeologists conjecture that each of these lines were part of a kind of accountability system for the game, where numbers represented, for a given day, the value of the pot at the beginning, the bet and the value of the pot at the end.</p><p>For example, a line with the number</p><p><code>10000 1500 11500</code></p><p>could mean that there was only one turn where the player won with label <code>1</code>. Another possibility is that there were three turns with results <code>2</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>-2</code>.</p><p>On the other hand, there were found other tablets with triplets of numbers that seem like the above described that, however, cannot represent results of a game day. There is no hypothesis of what they are.</p><p>Archeologists want to validate their hypothesis analyzing batches of tablets with triplets. They want to estimate the number of people that played in a day. To begin, they want to establish, for each triplet of numbers in a tablet that could represent a result of a game day, the minimal number of players that played that day. In the above example the answer to this question is <code>1</code>. Tablets that cannot represent results should be identified.
