Occasionally the head-teacher brought the kids of flymouse&rsquo;s class a large bag of candies and had flymouse distribute them. All the kids loved candies very much and often compared the numbers of candies they got with others. A kid A could had the idea that though it might be the case that another kid B was better than him in some aspect and therefore had a reason for deserving more candies than he did, he should never get a certain number of candies fewer than B did no matter how many candies he actually got, otherwise he would feel dissatisfied and go to the head-teacher to complain about flymouse&rsquo;s biased distribution.</p><p>snoopy shared class with flymouse at that time. flymouse always compared the number of his candies with that of snoopy&rsquo;s. He wanted to make the difference between the numbers as large as possible while keeping every kid satisfied. Now he had just got another bag of candies from the head-teacher, what was the largest difference he could make out of it?</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input contains a single test cases.
