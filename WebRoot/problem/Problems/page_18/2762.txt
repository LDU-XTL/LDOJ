</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In order to make their sons brave, Jiajia and Wind take them to a big cave. The cave has n rooms, and one-way corridors connecting some rooms. Each time, Wind choose two rooms x and y, and ask one of their little sons go from one to the other. The son can either go from x to y, or from y to x. Wind promised that her tasks are all possible, but she actually doesn't know how to decide if a task is possible. To make her life easier, Jiajia decided to choose a cave in which every pair of rooms is a possible task. Given a cave, can you tell Jiajia whether Wind can randomly choose two rooms without worrying about anything?</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
