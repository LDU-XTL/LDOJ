<br>Some day, Tom's father buys him a box of dominoes blocks. In the box, there are 12 different blocks, which are shown above. Tom is a boy who likes to do practice in intelligence, so he spends a whole afternoon in finishing two different rectangles with 3 * 20, which are shown below.

<br>①⑧⑧⑧⑦⑥⑥⑩⑨⑨⑨⑿⑿⑤⑾⑾③③③④
<br>①①①⑧⑥⑥⑩⑩⑩⑨⑤⑤⑤⑤⑾⑾⑾③④④
<br>
<br>Tom is sure that these are the only solutions for 3 * 20, and he wants to know the number of solutions for 4 * 15, 5 * 12, ... Can you help him?
<br>
<br>You should notice that if a solution will be the same as the other by some flip or rotate, these two solutions should be consider as the same.
