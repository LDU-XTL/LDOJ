</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The little cat takes over the management of a new park. There is a large circular statue in the center of the park, surrounded by N pots of flowers. Each potted flower will be assigned to an integer number (possibly negative) denoting how attractive it is. See the following graph as an example:
<br>
<br>(Positions of potted flowers are assigned to index numbers in the range of 1 ... N. The i-th pot and the (i + 1)-th pot are consecutive for any given i (1 <= i < N), and 1st pot is next to N-th pot in addition.)

<br> 
<br>The board chairman informed the little cat to construct "ONE arc-style cane-chair" for tourists having a rest, and the sum of attractive values of the flowers beside the cane-chair should be as large as possible. You should notice that a cane-chair cannot be a total circle, so the number of flowers beside the cane-chair may be 1, 2, ..., N - 1, but cannot be N. In the above example, if we construct a cane-chair in the position of that red-dashed-arc, we will have the sum of 3+(-2)+1+2=4, which is the largest among all possible constructions.
<br>
<br>Unluckily, some booted cats always make trouble for the little cat, by changing some potted flowers to others. The intelligence agency of little cat has caught up all the M instruments of booted cats' action. Each instrument is in the form of "A B", which means changing the A-th potted flowered with a new one whose attractive value equals to B. You have to report the new "maximal sum" after each instruction.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">There will be a single test data in the input. You are given an integer N (4 <= N <= 100000) in the first input line. 
<br>
<br>The second line contains N integers, which are the initial attractive value of each potted flower. The i-th number is for the potted flower on the i-th position.
<br>
<br>A single integer M (4 <= M <= 100000) in the third input line, and the following M lines each contains an instruction "A B" in the form described above.
<br>
<br>Restriction: All the attractive values are within [-1000, 1000]. We guarantee the maximal sum will be always a positive integer.
