</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The SUM problem can be formulated as follows: given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many quadruplet (a, b, c, d ) &isin; A x B x C x D are such that a + b + c + d = 0 . In the following, we assume that all lists have the same size n . </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains the size of the lists n (this value can be as large as 4000).
