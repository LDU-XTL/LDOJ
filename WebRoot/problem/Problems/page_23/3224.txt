Students from the AI Lab are all extreme enthusiasts in table tennis and hold strong will to represent the lab in the competition. Limited by the quota, however, only one of them can be selected to play in the competition.</p><p>To make the selection fair, they agreed on a single round robin tournament, in which every pair of students played a match decided by best of 5 games. The one winning the most matches would become representative of the lab. Now Ava, head of the lab, has in hand a form containing the scores of all matches. Who should she decide on for the competition?</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains exactly one test case. The test case starts with a line containing <i>n</i> (2 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100), the number of students in the lab. Then follows an <i>n</i> × <i>n</i> matrix <i>A</i>. Each element in the matrix will be one of 0, 1, 2 and 3. The element at row <i>i</i> and column <i>j</i>, <i>a<sub>ij</sub></i>, is the number of games won by the <i>i</i>th student in his/her match with the <i>j</i>th student. Exactly one of <i>a<sub>ij</sub></i> and <i>a<sub>ji</sub></i> (<i>i</i> ≠ <i>j</i>) is 3 and the other one will be less than 3. All diagonal elements of the matrix are 0’s.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Output the number of the student who won the most matches.
