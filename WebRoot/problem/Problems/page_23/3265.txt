</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>In easier times, Farmer John's cows had no problems. These days, though, they have problems, lots of problems; they have <i>P</i> (1 &le; <i>P</i> &le; 300) problems, to be exact. They have quit providing milk and have taken regular jobs like all other good citizens. In fact, on a normal month they make <i>M</i> (1 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 1000) money.</p><p>Their problems, however, are so complex they must hire consultants to solve them. Consultants are not free, but they are competent: consultants can solve any problem in a single month. Each consultant demands two payments: one in advance (1 &le; <i>payment</i> &le; <i>M</i>) to be paid at the start of the month problem-solving is commenced and one more payment at the start of the month after the problem is solved (1 &le; <i>payment</i> &le; <i>M</i>). Thus, each month the cows can spend the money earned during the previous month to pay for consultants. Cows are spendthrifts: they can never save any money from month-to-month; money not used is wasted on cow candy.</p><p>Since the problems to be solved depend on each other, they must be solved mostly in order. For example, problem 3 must be solved before problem 4 or during the same month as problem 4.</p><p>Determine the number of months it takes to solve all of the cows' problems and pay for the solutions.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>M</i> and <i>P</i>.
<br>Lines 2..<i>P</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 describes problem <i>i</i> with two space-separated integers: <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>A<sub>i</sub></i>. <i>B<sub>i</sub></i> is the payment to the consult BEFORE the problem is solved; <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> is the payment to the consult AFTER the problem is solved.
