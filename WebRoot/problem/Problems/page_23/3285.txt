Let's call such a point an <em>isoobservation</em> point. There can be at most two such points and we are interested in finding the one that gives the largest angular diameter of the planets. </p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Input consists of several cases, each case is presented at a single line.
