Well, I&rsquo;m sure you all know the famous Pythagorean theorem. He found an amazing fact about triangles, that is if the triangle has a right angle, the following relation holds:</p><p align="center"><i>a</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>, where <i>c</i> is the length of the hypotenuse.</p><p>However, Pythagoras told us nothing more about the generalization below:</p><p align="center"><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is an integer.</p><p>It is a natural tendency for mathematicians to solve whether an equation has integer solutions or not. But for you, a future computer scientist, will you also try to do some of the mathematicians&rsquo; work?</p><p>To simplify this problem, you are only required to find out whether the above equation <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>n</i> has integer solutions.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The first line of the input is an integer <i>T</i> (<i>T</i> &le; 50), and the following <i>T</i> lines have an integer <i>n</i> each.
