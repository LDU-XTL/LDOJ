</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>While exploring his many farms, Farmer John has discovered a number of amazing wormholes. A wormhole is very peculiar because it is a one-way path that delivers you to its destination at a time that is BEFORE you entered the wormhole! Each of FJ's farms comprises <i>N</i> (1 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 500) fields conveniently numbered 1..<i>N</i>, <i>M</i> (1 &le; <i>M</i> &le; 2500) paths, and <i>W</i> (1 &le; <i>W</i> &le; 200) wormholes.</p><p>As FJ is an avid time-traveling fan, he wants to do the following: start at some field, travel through some paths and wormholes, and return to the starting field a time before his initial departure. Perhaps he will be able to meet himself :) .</p><p>To help FJ find out whether this is possible or not, he will supply you with complete maps to <i>F</i> (1 &le; <i>F</i> &le; 5) of his farms. No paths will take longer than 10,000 seconds to travel and no wormhole can bring FJ back in time by more than 10,000 seconds.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single integer, <i>F</i>. <i>F</i> farm descriptions follow.
