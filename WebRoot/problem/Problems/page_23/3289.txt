</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Granny is preparing moonshine whiskey for an upcoming family reunion. Because her family is large, she needs to make several batches of whiskey, which she collects in a large metal cream can. After making, and sampling, several batches Granny stumbles and knocks the can on its side. Fortunately, the lid is tightly fixed so no whiskey is lost. </p><p>Our question to you is this: assuming that the depth of whiskey in the can was <i>k</i> cm with the can sitting upright, what is its depth with the can lying horizontal? The can itself is made of two cylinders: the body with height <i>h<sub>b</sub></i> and diameter <i>d<sub>b</sub></i>, and the neck with height <i>h<sub>n</sub></i> and diameter <i>d<sub>n</sub></i>. The neck and body are joined by a tapered conic shoulder such that the overall height of the can is <i>h</i>. The bottom and lid of the can are disks of diameter <i>d<sub>b</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>n</sub></i> respectively. </p><center><img src=images/3289_1.gif></center></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Input consists of several test cases.
