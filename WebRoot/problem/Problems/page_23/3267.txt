Their cowmunication system, based on mooing, is not very accurate; sometimes they hear words that do not make any sense. For instance, Bessie once received a message that said &quot;browndcodw&quot;. As it turns out, the intended message was &quot;browncow&quot; and the two letter &quot;d&quot;s were noise from other parts of the barnyard.</p><p>The cows want you to help them decipher a received message (also containing only characters in the range 'a'..'z') of length <i>L</i> (2 &le; <i>L</i> &le; 300) characters that is a bit garbled.
