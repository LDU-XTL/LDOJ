And it was just finished. Contrary to her wish, however, things turns out to be more complex as the cheesy glass walls always reflect much of the light rather than let it all pass through. Thus the walls are actually transparent mirrors. As a result, when someone wants to locate a place in the den, he will see a bundle of it and gets lost even easier.</p><p>Anyway, to change it back can be another torturing labor which the exhausted Kylin does not want. She has to think about setting up some signposts. In the first place, she needs to know how many images (including the real one) of an object one can see from a particular place. There are two important rules of counting:</p><ol><li>Any light that is reflected by the same wall twice will be ignored as it is getting too faint to recognize.</li><li>Light passes through exactly the fringes of some walls does not vanish.</li></ol></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains exactly one test case given as specified below:</p><table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse"><tr><td>Line 1</td><td>Four integers <i>x<sub>m</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>m</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>d</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>d</sub></i>, suggesting the locations of the observer (<i>x<sub>m</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>m</sub></i>) and the object (<i>x<sub>d</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>d</sub></i>).
