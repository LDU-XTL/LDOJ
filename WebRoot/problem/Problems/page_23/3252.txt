They can't even flip a coin because it's so hard to toss using hooves.</p><p>They have thus resorted to &quot;round number&quot; matching. The first cow picks an integer less than two billion. The second cow does the same. If the numbers are both &quot;round numbers&quot;, the first cow wins,<br>otherwise the second cow wins.</p><p>A positive integer <i>N</i> is said to be a &quot;round number&quot; if the binary representation of <i>N</i> has as many or more zeroes than it has ones. For example, the integer 9, when written in binary form, is 1001. 1001 has two zeroes and two ones; thus, 9 is a round number. The integer 26 is 11010 in binary; since it has two zeroes and three ones, it is not a round number.</p><p>Obviously, it takes cows a while to convert numbers to binary, so the winner takes a while to determine. Bessie wants to cheat and thinks she can do that if she knows how many &quot;round numbers&quot; are in a given range.</p><p>Help her by writing a program that tells how many round numbers appear in the inclusive range given by the input (1 ≤ <i>Start</i> &lt; <i>Finish</i> ≤ 2,000,000,000).</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: Two space-separated integers, respectively <i>Start</i> and <i>Finish</i>.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Line 1: A single integer that is the count of round numbers in the inclusive range <i>Start</i>..<i>Finish</i></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2 12</pre><p class="pst">Sample Output</p><pre class="sio">6</pre><p class="pst">
