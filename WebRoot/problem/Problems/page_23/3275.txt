However, he needs to know whether cow 1 > cow 3 to determine the cow with the second highest rank. Also, he will need one more question to determine the ordering between cow 4 and cow 5. After that, he will need to know if cow 5 > cow 3 if cow 1 has higher rank than cow 3. He will have to ask three questions in order to be sure he has the rankings: "Is cow 1 > cow 3?  Is cow 4 > cow 5? Is cow 5 > cow 3?"</div><p class="pst">
