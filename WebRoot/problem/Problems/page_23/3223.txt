But because they are unable to find enough men to build up two 11-player teams for a full match, they have decided on a modified version of penalty shootout!</p><p>In a normal penalty shootout, the ball should always be put on the spot in the area before the taker tries his luck. Yet for these fans, this is far too unchallenging for the goalkeepers among them. Now the penalty takers are allowed more choices of positions for the ball – anywhere on a straight line segment that is chosen in advance.</p><p>Players tend to carefully choose the point to place the ball so that the field angle spanned by the goal with respect to the ball is as large as possible, hoping to have a better chance in hitting the bottom of the net. In real situations, to make the angle really the largest one seems to be impossible, for man’s perception works seemingly better with fuzziness than accuracy. But for you, a contestant in programming, this would not be too difficult for you have the computer before your eyes as an aid, provided that you are given the exact descriptions of the goal and the line segment for placing the ball.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><script lang="text/javascript">function vec(v, a){var V = document.getElementById(v);var A = document.getElementById(a);	A.style.verticalAlign=V.offsetHeight/2;A.style.marginLeft=-(A.offsetWidth+V.offsetWidth)/2;A.style.marginRight=(V.offsetWidth-A.offsetWidth)/2;}</script><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains multiple test cases.
