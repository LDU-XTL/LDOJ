</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>You are downloading some things using a software (Flashget, maybe), but suddenly you have to go away for something. So, you need a program to calculate when the tasks will complete.</p><p>Now you know every download's speed, size and max speed. When a task is over, the bandwidth used is distributed by other tasks.
