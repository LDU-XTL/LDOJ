But as every old story goes, evil things will keep happening now and then. This day, a letter arrived at Ikki&rsquo;s, saying that his friend, frkstyc, was kidnapped in the Wonderland of TopCoders.</p><p>It is not known who kidnapped frkstyc but it is known that he is a favorite of algorithmic contests and the reason for his kidnapping frkstyc was that he can&rsquo;t solve a enumeration problem <tt>=.=</tt>, so he kidnapped frkstyc to help him. (What? Why not kidnap ACRush? Well&hellip; Still remember the story told by Guo Wei in Xi&rsquo;an? &mdash; &ldquo;Then why me but not somebody else!!&rdquo;, yells frkstyc.)</p><p>Well, now frkstyc&rsquo;s life is at stake! He is encountered with such a problem:</p><p>You know what a tree in graph theory is, right? Well, I&rsquo;m interested in numbering the trees in such a way that the number of a vertex is always smaller than those of its descendants. And I&rsquo;m interested in making the trees into forests such that there are <i>n</i> nodes and <i>k</i> leaves, satisfying the above property in each tree. Now tell me how many ways can I number such forests!</p><p>Being a contestant at POJ, you&rsquo;re sure that if there&rsquo;s no frkstyc, there will be no POJ Monthly for a time&hellip; So try your best to save his life!</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains one or more lines ended with an integer pair &ldquo;<code>0 0</code>&rdquo;.
