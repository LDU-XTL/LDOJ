One day the company receives <i>M</i> repair tasks, the <i>i</i>th of which occurs in block <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>, has a deadline <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> on any repairman&rsquo;s arrival, which is also its starting time, and takes a single repairman <i>d<sub>i</sub></i> time to finish. Repairmen work alone on all tasks and must finish one task before moving on to another. With a map of the city in hand, Lily want to know the minimum number of repairmen that have to be assign to this day&rsquo;s tasks.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing <i>Q</i> and <i>M</i> (0 &lt; <i>Q</i> &le; 20, 0 &lt; <i>M</i> &le; 200). Then follow <i>Q</i> lines each with <i>Q</i> integers, which represent a <i>Q</i> &times; <i>Q</i> matrix &Delta; = {&delta;<i><sub>ij</sub></i>}, where &delta;<i><sub>ij</sub></i> means a bidirectional road connects the <i>i</i>th and the <i>j</i>th blocks and requires &delta;<i><sub>ij</sub></i> time to go from one end to another. If &delta;<i><sub>ij</sub></i> = &minus;1, such a road does not exist. The matrix is symmetric and all its diagonal elements are zeroes. Right below the matrix are <i>M</i> lines describing the repairing tasks. The <i>i</i>th of these lines contains <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>i</sub></i>.
