</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>After years of toil designing and evaluating varieties of complex networks, Michelle, an elite engineer, has recently made the decision to develop an assistant software to help herself out.</p><p>Consider a network built up with undirected water supply pipes each connecting a pair of junctions that supply or consume water. A shortcut of length <i>L</i> is defined as a sequence of&nbsp; <i>L</i> distinct junctions such that two junctions are adjacent in the network if and only if they are adjacent in the sequence. A network is regarded speedy if there is no shortcut with a length greater than three.</p><p>Now, please try to work out an efficient solution for Michelle to determine whether a network is speedy or not.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains exactly one test case given as specified below:</p><table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse"><tr><td>Line 1</td><td>Two integers <i>N</i> (1 &lt; <i>N</i> &lt; 1,200) and <i>M</i>, which are the numbers of junctions and pipes, respectively.</td></tr><tr><td>Line 2 â€“ <i>M</i> + 1</td><td>Two integer <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> (1 &le; <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> &le; <i>N</i>) on each line, describing a pipe connecting junctions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</td></tr></table><p>You can assume that there exists a path between any two junctions.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>Output &ldquo;<code>Yes</code>&rdquo; if the network is speedy, otherwise print &ldquo;<code>No</code>&rdquo;.</p></span></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">4 4
