Ikki finds that the biggest problem in the country is that transportation speed is too slow.</p><p>Since Ikki was an ACM/ICPC contestant before, he realized that this, indeed, is a maximum flow problem. He coded a maximum flow program and found the answer. Not satisfied with the current status of the transportation speed, he wants to increase the transportation ability of the nation. The method is relatively simple, Ikki will reconstruct some roads in this transportation network, to make those roads afford higher capacity in transportation. But unfortunately, the country of Phoenix is not so rich in GDP that there is only enough money to rebuild one road. Ikki wants to find such roads that if reconstructed, the total capacity of transportation will increase.</p><p>He thought this problem for a loooong time but cannot get it. So he gave this problem to frkstyc, who put it in this POJ Monthly contest for you to solve. Can you solve it for Ikki?</p></span></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains exactly one test case.</p><p>The first line of the test case contains two integers <i>N</i>, <i>M</i> (<i>N</i> &le; 500, <i>M</i> &le; 5,000) which represents the number of cities and roads in the country, Phoenix, respectively.</p><p><i>M</i> lines follow, each line contains three integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, which means that there is a road from city <i>a</i> to city <i>b</i> with a transportation capacity of <i>c</i> (0 &le; <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> &lt; <i>n</i>, <i>c</i> &le; 100).
