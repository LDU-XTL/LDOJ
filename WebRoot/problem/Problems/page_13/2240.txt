</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Arbitrage is the use of discrepancies in currency exchange rates to transform one unit of a currency into more than one unit of the same currency. For example, suppose that 1 US Dollar buys 0.5 British pound, 1 British pound buys 10.0 French francs, and 1 French franc buys 0.21 US dollar. Then, by converting currencies, a clever trader can start with 1 US dollar and buy 0.5 * 10.0 * 0.21 = 1.05 US dollars, making a profit of 5 percent. 
<br>
<br>Your job is to write a program that takes a list of currency exchange rates as input and then determines whether arbitrage is possible or not.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input will contain one or more test cases. Om the first line of each test case there is an integer n (1<=n<=30), representing the number of different currencies. The next n lines each contain the name of one currency. Within a name no spaces will appear. The next line contains one integer m, representing the length of the table to follow. The last m lines each contain the name ci of a source currency, a real number rij which represents the exchange rate from ci to cj and a name cj of the destination currency. Exchanges which do not appear in the table are impossible.
<br>Test cases are separated from each other by a blank line. Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for n. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, print one line telling whether arbitrage is possible or not in the format "Case case: Yes" respectively "Case case: No". </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3
