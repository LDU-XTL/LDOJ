</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Maja is a bee. She lives in a bee hive with thousands of other bees. This bee hive consists of many hexagonal honey combs where the honey is stored in. 
<br>But bee Maja has a problem. Willi told her where she can meet him, but because Willi is a male drone and Maja is a female worker they have different coordinate systems.

<br>Help Maja to convert Willi's system to hers. Write a program which for a given honey comb number gives the coordinates in Maja's system. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains one or more integers which represent Willi's numbers. Each number stands on its own in a separate line, directly followed by a newline.
