</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Let us consider an undirected graph G = < V,E >. Let us denote by N(v) the set of vertices connected to vertex v (i.e. the set of neighbours of v). Recall that the number of vertices connected to v is called the degree of this vertex and is denoted by deg v.
<br>We will call graph G strange if it is connected and for its every vertex v the following conditions are satisfied:
<br><blockquote>1. deg v >= 2 (i.e. there are at least two vertices connected to v)
<br>2. If deg v = 2 then the two neighbours of v are not connected by an edge
<br>3. If degv > 2 then there is u ∈ N(v), such that the following is true:
<br><blockquote>(a) deg u = 2
<br>(b) Any two different vertices w1,w2 ∈ N(v) \ {u} are connected, i.e. (w1,w2) ∈ E.</blockquote></blockquote>
<br>You are given some strange graph G. Find hamiltonian cycle in it, i.e. find such cycle that it goes through every vertex of G exactly once.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains two integer numbers N and M -- the number of vertices and edges in G respectively (3 <= N <= 10 000, M <= 100 000). 2M integer numbers follow -- each pair represents vertices connected by the corresponding edge (vertices are numbered from 1 to N). It is guaranteed that each edge occurs exactly once in the input file and that there are no loops (i.e. ends of each edge are distinct).</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">If there is no hamiltonian cycle in G, print -1 on the first line of the output file. In the other case output N numbers -- the sequence of vertices of G as they appear in the hamiltonian cycle found (note that the last vertex must be connected to the first one). If there are several solutions, output any one.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">4 4
