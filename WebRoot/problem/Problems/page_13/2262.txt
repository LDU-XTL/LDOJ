</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In 1742, Christian Goldbach, a German amateur mathematician, sent a letter to Leonhard Euler in which he made the following conjecture: 
<br><blockquote>Every even number greater than 4 can be
<br>written as the sum of two odd prime numbers. </blockquote>
<br>For example: 
<br><blockquote>8 = 3 + 5. Both 3 and 5 are odd prime numbers. 
<br>20 = 3 + 17 = 7 + 13. 
<br>42 = 5 + 37 = 11 + 31 = 13 + 29 = 19 + 23. </blockquote>
<br>Today it is still unproven whether the conjecture is right. (Oh wait, I have the proof of course, but it is too long to write it on the margin of this page.) 
<br>Anyway, your task is now to verify Goldbach's conjecture for all even numbers less than a million.
