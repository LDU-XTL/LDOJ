</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Map generation is a difficult task in cartography. A vital part of such task is automatic labeling of the cities in a map; where for each city there is text label to be attached to its location, so that no two labels overlap. In this problem, we are concerned with a simple case of automatic map labeling.
<br>
<br>Assume that each city is a point on the plane, and its label is a text bounded in a square with edges parallel to x and y axis. The label of each city should be located such that the city point appears exactly in the middle of the top or bottom edges of the label. In a good labeling, the square labels are all of the same size, and no two labels overlap, although they may share one edge. Figure 1 depicts an example of a good labeling (the texts of the labels are not shown.)
<br>
<br>Given the coordinates of all city points on the map as integer values, you are to find the maximum label size (an integer value) such that a good labeling exists for the map.
