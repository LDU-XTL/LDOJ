</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Write a program that performs symbolic derivation f'(x) = df(x)/dx of a given function f(x). The function f(x) is defined by an expression which may contain the following operations: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and ln (natural logarithm). Besides, the operands may be the variable x and numerical constants. The expression may contain arbitrarily nested sub-expressions in parentheses ( ). The expression is given in a usual, infix form, such as:
<br>(2*ln(x+1.7)-x*x)/((-7)+3.2*x*x)+(x+3*x)*x
<br>
<br>Numerical constants have the form d.d, with an optional sign (+ or -), where the number of digits both in integer and decimal parts are arbitrary. The input expression is guaranteed to be correct (no syntax error can occur).
<br>
<br>The output expression should be written in infix form. It should not be optimized for human reading. This means, it can contain redundancies, such as 0*x, 1*x, 0+x, etc. The derivation should be performed using the following rules:
<br>
<br>1. The operators * and / are of higher priority than the operators + and -. Parentheses may change the priorities as usually.
<br>
<br>2. The operators +, -, *, and / are left-associative, meaning that they group from left to right:
<br>a*b*c = (a*b)*c, a/b/c = (a/b)/c, a/b*c = (a/b)*c, etc.
<br>
<br>3. The rules for derivation are:
<br><pre>(a + b)' = a' + b'
<br>(a - b)' = a' - b'
<br>(a * b)' = (a' * b + a * b')
<br>(a / b)' = (a' * b - a * b') / b^2		Note: use b^2 and not (b*b) for presentation
<br>ln(a)' = (a')/(a)
<br>x' = 1
<br>const' = 0</pre>
<br>
<br>4. While producing the symbolic derivation, use parentheses for output strictly as stated in the previous rule. Do not perform presentation optimizations, such as 0*a = 0, 1*a = a, etc.
