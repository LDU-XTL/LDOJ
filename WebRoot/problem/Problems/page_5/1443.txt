</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">It is required to find out whether it is possible to delete given files from MS-DOS directory executing the DEL command of MS-DOS operation system only once. There are no nested subdirectories.
<br>
<br>
<br>A note 
<br>
<br>DEL command has the following format: DEL wildcard
<br>
<br>
<br>The actual wildcard as well as a full file name can be made up either of a name containing 1 up to 8 characters or of a name and extension, containing up to 3 characters. The point character "." separates the extension from the file name. The extension can be empty and this is equivalent to a name without any extension (in this case a wildcard ends with a point). In a wildcard the characters "?" and "*" can be used. A question mark substitutes exactly one character of the full file name excluding a point, an asterisk - any sequence of characters (containing no points) even empty one. An asterisk can appear only at the last position of the name and the extension.
<br>
<br>
<br>MS-DOS system can permit maybe other wildcards but they can not be used in this task. File names and extensions consist only of Latin capitals and digits.
