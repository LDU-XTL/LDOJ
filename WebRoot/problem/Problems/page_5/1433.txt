</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Given n integer registers r1, r2, ..., rn we define a Compare-Exchange Instruction CE(a, b), where a, b are register indices (1 <= a < b <= n):
<br>
<br>CE(a, b)::
<br>if content(ra) > content(rb) then
<br>exchange the contents of registers ra and rb;
<br>
<br>A Compare-Exchange program (shortly CE-program) is any nite sequence of Compare-Exchange instructions. A CE-program is called a Minimum-Finding program if after its execution the register r1 always contains the smallest value among all values in the registers. Such program is called reliable if it remains a Minimum-Finding program after removing any single Compare-Exchange instruction.
<br>
<br>Given a CE-program P , what is the smallest number of instructions that should be added at the end of program P in order to get a reliable Minimum-Finding program?
<br>
<br>
<br>Example
<br>
<br>Consider the following CE-program for 3 registers:
<br>
<br>CE(1, 2); CE(2, 3); CE(1, 2).
<br>
<br>In order to make this program a reliable Minimum-Finding program it is sufficient to add only two instructions, CE(1, 3) and CE(1, 2).
<br>
<br>
<br>Task
<br>
<br>Write a program which for each data set:
<br>reads the description of a CE-program,
<br>computes the smallest number of CE-instructions that should be added to make this program a reliable Minimum-Finding program, 
<br>writes the result.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to the number of data sets, 1 <= d <=10. The data sets follow.
<br>
<br>Each data set consists of exactly two consecutive lines.
<br>
<br>The first of those lines contains exactly two integers n and m separated by a single space, 2 <= n <= 10 000, 0 <= m <= 25 000. Integer n is the number of registers and integer m is the number of program instructions. 
<br>
<br>The second of those lines contains exactly 2m integers separated by single spaces - the program 
<br>itself. Integers aj, bj on positions 2j -1 and 2j, 1 < j < m, 1 <= aj < bj <= n, are parameters of the j-th instruction in the program.
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The output should consist of exactly d lines, one line for each data set.
<br>
<br>Line i, 1 <= i <= d, should contain only one integer - the smallest number of instructions that should be added at the end of the i-th input program in order to make this program a reliable Minimum-Finding program.
