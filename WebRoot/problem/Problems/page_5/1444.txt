</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Two points A(x1, y1, z1) and B(x2, y2, z2) are placed on the surface of parallelepiped P = {(x, y, z): 0 <= x <= L, 0 <= y <= W, 0 <= z <= H} with L*W*H dimensions (see figure). These two points can be linked with various curves lying on the surface of P. You are to find out the square of the shortest curve length.
<br>
<br>Parallelepiped dimensions L, W, H and coordinates of the points are integers, 0 <= L,W,H <= 1000.
