</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A subsequence of a given sequence is the given sequence with some elements (possible none) left out. Given a sequence X = < x1, x2, ..., xm > another sequence Z = < z1, z2, ..., zk > is a subsequence of X if there exists a strictly increasing sequence < i1, i2, ..., ik > of indices of X such that for all j = 1,2,...,k, x<sub>i<sub>j</sub></sub> = zj. For example, Z = < a, b, f, c > is a subsequence of X = < a, b, c, f, b, c > with index sequence < 1, 2, 4, 6 >. Given two sequences X and Y the problem is to find the length of the maximum-length common subsequence of X and Y. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The program input is from the std input.
