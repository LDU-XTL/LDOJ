</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The fastfood chain McBurger owns several restaurants along a highway. Recently, they have decided to build several depots along the highway, each one located at a restaurant and supplying several of the restaurants with the needed ingredients. Naturally, these depots should be placed so that the average distance between a restaurant and its assigned depot is minimized. You are to write a program that computes the optimal positions and assignments of the depots. 
<br>
<br>To make this more precise, the management of McBurger has issued the following specification: You will be given the positions of n restaurants along the highway as n integers d1 < d2 < ... < dn (these are the distances measured from the company's headquarter, which happens to be at the same highway). Furthermore, a number k (k <= n) will be given, the number of depots to be built. 
<br>
<br>The k depots will be built at the locations of k different restaurants. Each restaurant will be assigned to the closest depot, from which it will then receive its supplies. To minimize shipping costs, the total distance sum, defined as
<br>
<br> n
<br> âˆ‘ |di - (position of depot serving restaurant i)|
<br>i=1
<br>
<br>must be as small as possible.
<br>
<br>Write a program that computes the positions of the k depots, such that the total distance sum is minimized. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input file contains several descriptions of fastfood chains. Each description starts with a line containing the two integers n and k. n and k will satisfy 1 <= n <= 200, 1 <= k <= 30, k <= n. Following this will n lines containing one integer each, giving the positions di of the restaurants, ordered increasingly.
<br>
<br>The input file will end with a case starting with n = k = 0. This case should not be processed. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each chain, first output the number of the chain. Then output an optimal placement of the depots as follows: for each depot output a line containing its position and the range of restaurants it serves. If there is more than one optimal solution, output any of them. After the depot descriptions output a line containing the total distance sum, as defined in the problem text. 
<br>
<br>Output a blank line after each test case.
