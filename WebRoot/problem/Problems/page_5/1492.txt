</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The quality of pseudo random-number generators used in some computations, especially simulation, is a significant issue. Proposed generation algorithms are subjected to many tests to establish their quality, or, more usually, their lack of it. One of the common tests is the run test. 
<br>
<br>In this test, sequences are tested for ``runs up" and ``runs down." 
<br>
<br>We will examine series of data values for the ``Up" and ``Down" sequences each series contains. 
<br>
<br>Within a series, an ``Up" sequence continues as long as each data-value received is not less than the previous data-value. An ``Up" sequence terminates when a data-value received is less than the previous data-value received. 
<br>
<br>A ``Down" sequence continues as long as each data-value received is not greater than the previous data-value. A ``Down" sequence terminates when a data-value received is greater than the previous data-value received. 
<br>
<br>An ``Up" sequence can be initiated by the termination of a ``Down" sequence and vice versa. (Sequences initiated in this manner have length one at this initiation point.) 
<br>
<br>All the initial data-values are part of an ``Up" sequence, and contribute to its length, if the first deviation of the data-values is upwards. 
<br>
<br>All the initial data-values are part of a ``Down" sequence, and contribute to its length, if the first deviation of the data-values is downwards. 
<br>
<br>If the data-values received don't allow classification as either an ``Up" or a ``Down" sequence, the data should be considered to have neither sequence. 
<br>
<br>Find the average length of both the ``Up" and the ``Down" sequences encountered for each input line in the data file. Report these average lengths as each input line is processed. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Each of the separate series to be examined is contained on a single line of input. 
<br>
<br>Each series to be analyzed consists of at least one and no more than 30 unsigned, non-zero integers. Each integer in a series has at least one digit and no more than four digits. The integers are separated from each other by a single blank character. Each of the series will be terminated by a single zero (0) digit. This terminator should not be considered as being part of the series being analyzed. 
<br>
<br>The set of series to be analyzed is terminated by a single zero (0) digit as the input on a line. This terminator should not be considered to be a series, and no output should be produced in response to its encounter. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A line with two real values is to be emitted for each input data set encountered. It must begin with the message ``Nr values = N: ", where N is the number of input data in the line; and then to continue with the average values for runs. 
<br>
<br>First, the average ``Up" run length, then the average ``Down" run length. Separate these values with a space. 
<br>
<br>Answers must be rounded to six digits after the decimal point. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">1 2 3 0
