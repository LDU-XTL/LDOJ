</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The CE digital company has built an Automatic Painting Machine (APM) to paint a flat board fully covered by adjacent non-overlapping rectangles of different sizes each with  a predefined color.
<br><center><img src=images/1691_1.jpg></center>
<br>To color the board, the APM has access to a set of brushes. Each brush has a distinct color C. The APM picks one brush with color C and paints all possible rectangles having predefined color C with the following restrictions:
<br>To avoid leaking the paints and mixing colors, a rectangle can  only  be painted if all rectangles immediately above it have already  been painted. For example rectangle labeled F in Figure 1 is painted only after rectangles C and D are painted. Note that each rectangle must be painted at once, i.e. partial painting of one rectangle is not allowed.
<br>You are to write a  program for APM  to paint a  given  board  so that the number of  brush pick-ups is minimum.  Notice that if one brush is picked up more than once, all pick-ups are counted.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line of the input file contains an integer M which is the number of test cases to solve  (1 <= M <= 10). For each test case, the first line contains an integer N, the number of rectangles, followed by N lines describing the rectangles. Each rectangle R is specified by 5 integers in one line: the y and x coordinates of the upper left corner of R, the y and x coordinates of the lower right corner of R, followed by the color-code of R.
<br>Note that: 
<br><ol><li>Color-code is an integer in the range of 1 .. 20.
<br><li>Upper left corner of the board coordinates is always (0,0).
<br><li>Coordinates are in the range of 0 .. 99.
<br><li>N is in the range of 1..15.</ol>
