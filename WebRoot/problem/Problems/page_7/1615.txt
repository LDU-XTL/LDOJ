</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Let S be a sequence of n integers, where S[k] with 1 <= k <= n denotes the k-th number of S. The maximum prefix sum of S, denoted h(S), is defined to be
<br><div align=center>h(S) = max<sub>0<=j<=n</sub>∑<sub>1<=k<=j</sub>S[k].</div>
<br>(Note that the range for j starting from 0 is to ensure h(S) >= 0, because ∑<sub>1<=k<=0</sub>S[k]=0.) For example, if
<br>W = −2, 1,−3;
<br>X = 1, 2, 4, 3,−1,−5, 2, 0,−1, 3,−2;
<br>Y = −1, 2, 0, 1, 3,−5, 3, 2, 4,−2,−1,
<br>then h(W) = 0, h(X) = 1+2+4+3 = 10 and h(Y) = −1+2+0+1+3−5+3+2+4 = 9.
<br>For each i = 1, 2, . . . , l, let Si be a sequence of ni integers. We say that a sequence S of n numbers is a merged sequence of S1, S2, . . . , Sl if the following conditions hold.
<br>1. n = n1 + n2 + ... + nl.
<br>2. There is a 1-1 mapping f from {1, 2, . . . , n} to {(i, j) | 1 <= i <= l and 1 <= j <= ni} such that if f(t) = (i, j) then S[t] = Si[j].
<br>3. If t < t', f(t) = (i, j) and f(t') = (i, j'), then j < j'.
<br>For example, if we have
<br>S1 = 1, 3,−5, 2,−2;
<br>S2 = 2, 4,−1;
<br>S3 = −1, 0, 3,
<br>then both X and Y above are merged sequences of S1, S2, S3. The following sequence,however, is not a merged sequence of S1, S2, S3.
<br>Z = 1, 3,−5, 2,−2, 2, 4,−1,−1, 3, 0.
<br>(Clearly, if the last two numbers 3 and 0 in Z are exchanged, then the resulting sequence is a merged sequence of S1, S2, S3.)
<br>Your job is to produce a merged sequence S of S1, S2, . . . , Sl with minimum h(S*).
<br>For instance, the following sequence is a merged sequence for the above S1, S2, S3 whose maximum prefix sum is minimized:
<br>S* = −1, 1, 0, 3,−5, 2,−2, 2, 4,−1, 3.
<br>One can verify that h(S) = −1 + 1 + 0 + 3 − 5 + 2 − 2 + 2 + 4 − 1 + 3 = 6.
