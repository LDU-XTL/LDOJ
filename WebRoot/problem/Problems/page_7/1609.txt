</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Michael The Kid receives an interesting game set from his grandparent as his birthday gift. Inside the game set box, there are n tiling blocks and each block has a form as follows:
<br><center><img src=images/1609_1.jpg></center>
<br>Each tiling block is associated with two parameters (l,m), meaning that the upper face of the block is packed with l protruding knobs on the left and m protruding knobs on the middle. Correspondingly, the bottom face of an (l,m)-block is carved with l caving dens on the left and m dens on the middle.
<br>It is easily seen that an (l,m)-block can be tiled upon another (l,m)-block. However,this is not the only way for us to tile up the blocks. Actually, an (l,m)-block can be tiled upon another (l',m')-block if and only if l >= l' and m >= m'.
<br>Now the puzzle that Michael wants to solve is to decide what is the tallest tiling blocks he can make out of the given n blocks within his game box. In other words, you are given a collection of n blocks B = {b1, b2, . . . , bn} and each block bi is associated with two parameters (li,mi). The objective of the problem is to decide the number of tallest tiling blocks made from B.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Several sets of tiling blocks. The inputs are just a list of integers.For each set of tiling blocks, the first integer n represents the number of blocks within the game box. Following n, there will be n lines specifying parameters of blocks in B; each line contains exactly two integers, representing left and middle parameters of the i-th block, namely, li and mi. In other words, a game box is just a collection of n blocks B = {b1, b2, . . . , bn} and each block bi is associated with two parameters (li,mi).
<br>Note that n can be as large as 10000 and li and mi are in the range from 1 to 100.
<br>An integer n = 0 (zero) signifies the end of input.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each set of tiling blocks B, output the number of the tallest tiling blocks can be made out of B. Output a single star '*' to signify the end of
