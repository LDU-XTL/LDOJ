</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A traditional game is played between two players on a pool of n numbers (not necessarily distinguishing ones).
<br>
<br>The first player will choose from the pool a number x1 lying in [a, b] (0 < a < b), which means a <= x1 <= b. Next the second player should choose a number y1 such that y1 - x1 lies in [a, b] (Attention! This implies y1 > x1 since a > 0). Then the first player should choose a number x2 such that x2 - y1 lies in [a, b]... The game ends when one of them cannot make a choice. Note that a player MUST NOT skip his turn.
<br>
<br>A player's score is determined by the numbers he has chose, by the way: 
<br>
<br>player1score = x1 + x2 + ...
<br>player2score = y1 + y2 + ...
<br>
<br>If you are player1, what is the maximum score difference (player1score - player2score) you can get? It is assumed that player2 plays perfectly.
