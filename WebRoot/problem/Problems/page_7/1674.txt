</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Given a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, we can always get the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., n by swapping pairs of numbers. For example, if the initial sequence is 2, 3, 5, 4, 1, we can sort them in the following way:
<br>
<br>2 3 5 4 1
<br>1 3 5 4 2
<br>1 3 2 4 5
<br>1 2 3 4 5
<br>
<br>Here three swaps have been used. The problem is, given a specific permutation, how many swaps we needs to take at least. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 20) that indicates the number of test cases. Then follow the t cases. Each case contains two lines. The first line contains the integer n (1 <= n <= 10000), and the second line gives the initial permutation.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each test case, the output will be only one integer, which is the least number of swaps needed to get the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., n from the initial permutation. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">2
