</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A sequence consisting of one digit, the number 1 is initially written into a computer. At each successive time step, the computer simultaneously tranforms each digit 0 into the sequence 1 0 and each digit 1 into the sequence 0 1. So, after the first time step, the sequence 0 1 is obtained; after the second, the sequence 1 0 0 1, after the third, the sequence 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 and so on.
