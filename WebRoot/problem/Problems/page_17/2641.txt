</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">In a billiard table with horizontal side a inches and vertical side b inches, a ball is launched from the middle of the table. After s > 0 seconds the ball returns to the point from which it was launched, after having made m bounces off the vertical sides and n bounces off the horizontal sides of the table. Find the launching angle A (measured from the horizontal), which will be between 0 and 90 degrees inclusive, and the initial velocity of the ball. 
<br>Assume that the collisions with a side are elastic (no energy loss), and thus the velocity component of the ball parallel to each side remains unchanged. Also, assume the ball has a radius of zero. Remember that, unlike pool tables, billiard tables have no pockets. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Input consists of a sequence of lines, each containing five nonnegative integers separated by whitespace. The five numbers are: a, b, s, m, and n, respectively. All numbers are positive integers not greater than 10000. 
<br>Input is terminated by a line containing five zeroes. 
<br></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each input line except the last, output a line containing two real numbers (accurate to two decimal places) separated by a single space. The first number is the measure of the angle A in degrees and the second is the velocity of the ball measured in inches per second, according to the description above. </div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">100 100 1 1 1
