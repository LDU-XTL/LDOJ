</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A software company wants to write a program to play a simple poker game. In the game, a player is given a hand, namely 5 distinct poker cards, from a deck of 52 distinct cards. A deck of 52 cards consists of 4suits of 13 cards each, coded and sequenced as A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, X,J, Q, and K. The 4 suits are club (C), heart (H), spade (S), and diamond(D).
<br>
<br>You tasks is to write a program to determine the points of a hand of 5cards using the following scoring rules:
<br><ul><li>Straight flush: 1000 points five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 76543 of hearts. Note that AKQJX is treated as a valid sequence.
<br><li>Four of a kind: 750 points four cards of the same rank accompanied by a "kicker", like 44442.
<br><li>Full house: 500 points three cards of one rank accompanied by two of another, such as 777JJ.
<br><li>Flush: 350 points five cards of the same suit, such as AJ942 of hearts.
<br><li>Straight: 250 points five cards in sequence, such as 76543. Note that AKQJX is treated as a valid sequence.
<br><li>Three of a kind: 200 points three cards of the same rank and two kickers of different ranks, such as KKK84.
<br><li>Two pairs: 100 points two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank and a kicker of a third rank, such as KK449.
<br><li>One pair: 50 points two cards of one rank accompanied by three kickers of different ranks, such as AAK53.
<br><li>None of the above: O point any hand that does not qualify as one of the better hands above, such as KJ542 of mixed suits.</ul>
<br>Note that if a hand satisfies two or more rules above, then we only apply the rule that wins the largest amount of points. For example, a "full house" consists of a "three of a kind" and a "one pair." You need to give
<br>the score for "full house" only (i.e., 500 points), and nothing else.</div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The first line contains the number of hands w, w <= 100. Then the w hands are listed one by one. Note that each hand comes from a complete deck of52 cards. Each hand is listed in one line with 5 cards. Each card consists of two upper case letters. The first letter is its suit, and the second letter is its rank. There is a blank between two cards. The cards in one hand are not sorted at all.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">For each hand, output its points in one line.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3
