Subsequent lines of input contain pairs of numbers Li and Ri (abs(Li), abs(Ri) <= 50000). Each pair is placed on separate line. Numbers in the pair are separated with space(s).

The list of segments of covering subset must follow. Format of the list must be the same as described in input with exception that ending pair "0 0" should not be printed. Segments should be printed in increasing order of their left end point coordinate.
