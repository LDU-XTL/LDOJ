</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">A game-board consists of N fields placed around a circle. Fields are successively numbered from1 to N clockwise. In some fields there may be obstacles.
<br>
<br>Player starts on a field marked with number 1. His goal is to reach a given field marked with number Z. The only way of moving is a clockwise jump of length K. The only restriction is that the fields the player may jump to should not contain any obstacle.
<br>
<br>For example, if N = 13, K = 3 and Z = 9, the player can jump across the fields 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 3, 6 and 9, reaching his goal under condition that none of these fields is occupied by an obstacle.
<br>
<br>Your task is to write a program that finds the smallest possible number K.
