</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The sequence of n − 1 consecutive composite numbers (positive integers that are not prime and not equal to 1) lying between two successive prime numbers <i>p</i> and <i>p</i> + <i>n</i> is called a prime gap of length <i>n</i>. For example, ‹24, 25, 26, 27, 28› between 23 and 29 is a prime gap of length 6.</p><p>Your mission is to write a program to calculate, for a given positive integer <i>k</i>, the length of the prime gap that contains <i>k</i>.

Each positive integer is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the 100000th prime number, which is 1299709. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing a single zero.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The output should be composed of lines each of which contains a single non-negative integer. It is the length of the prime gap that contains the corresponding positive integer in the input if it is a composite number, or 0 otherwise.
