</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>You have just finished your research of <i>FAMI </i>algorithm (see task “Map Generator”). You are very proud of yourself and even expect being paid bonus this month. Your boss, whose nickname is Dean, asks you to come over to his office for a moment. You expect thanks and even promotion. But …</p><p>‘What is this?’ asks Dean and shows you your latest report.</p><p>‘Well, h-m-m, these are results of my <i>FAMI</i> algorithm research, a-a-a,’ you answer. It seems that your dreams about soon promotion are … just dreams. But you still do not understand what is wrong about your report.</p><p>‘I can read, by the way,’ continues Dean. ‘I am talking about the absolute error. Why it is so big? I require better results!’</p><p>When you argue with your boss, the best argument is silence. So, now instead of bonuses and promotions you need to rewrite your program.</p><p>Developers wish the map generator produced <i>connected </i>maps. A map is said to be <i>connected </i>when between any pair of planets there is a path, consisting of one or more hyperspace tunnels. Unfortunately, it appears that maps generated by <i>FAMI</i> algorithm sometimes are not <i>connected</i>. You are assigned to research this phenomenon.</p><p>You need to write a program which being given numbers <b>N</b> and <b>P</b> calculates probability of generating <i>connected</i> map by <i>FAMI</i> algorithm.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input, as in the previous task, consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer number <b>N</b> (1 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 20), while the second line contains a real number <b>P</b> (0 ≤ <b>P</b> ≤ 1).</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The output needs to contain an answer - the single real number which is the probability of generating <i>connected </i>map by <i>FAMI </i>algorithm. Absolute error of the answer must not exceed <b>10<sup>−8</sup></b>.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">3
