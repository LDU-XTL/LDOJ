</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>AT-sequences are command strings used to control modems. An AT-sequence is a string of no more than 500 characters consisting of the prefix &#39;AT&#39; followed by some commands immediately one after another without any separators. Here is a simplified description of the modem commands.</p><p>Each command consists of a header and an optional numeric value (non-negative integer containing no more than 4 digits). If there is a value in the command, it is separated from the header by the character &#39;=&#39;.</p><p>The header itself also consists of two parts. The first, mandatory, part of a header has one of the following forms:</p><ul><li>one or two upper-case Latin letters;</li><li>one of the symbols &#39;&amp;&#39;, &#39;#&#39;, &#39;@&#39;, followed by one upper-case Latin letter.</li></ul><p>The second, optional part of a header is a non-negative integer containing no more than 20 digits.</p><p>Spaces are not allowed in the command notation. If the command notation contains only one or two Latin letters, this command can&#39;t precede another one with the notation started by a letter.</p><p>The task is to determine all commands included in the structure of a correct AT-sequence.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input contains one line with the source AT-sequence.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Each line of the output contains one command from the AT-sequence given in the input file. The commands must be listed in the same order as in the AT-sequence. If AT-sequence have no commands you must generate nothing.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">ATDP2934564&H0S0=4</pre><p class="pst">Sample Output</p><pre class="sio">DP2934564
