Similarly, a diagonal line segment is given as a set of <tt>’/’</tt> or <tt>’\’</tt> characters in adjacent cells in the same diagonal of the matrix. Of course, a line segment going from Northwest to Southeast has to be given using the <tt>’\’</tt> characters and a line segment going from Southwest to Northeast using the <tt>’/’</tt> characters.</p><p>Write a program that, given a pseudographical image, determines if it contains exactly one line segment – horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input contains several test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Next follow the descriptions of each test case. The first line of the test case description contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10), the number of rows and columns of the matrix, respectively. Each of the following N lines of the description contains exactly M symbols ‘.’, ‘‑’, ‘|’, ‘\’, or ‘/’.</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The output consists of <b>T</b> lines, one line per each test case.
