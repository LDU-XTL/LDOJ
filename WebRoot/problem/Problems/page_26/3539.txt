</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Edward works as an engineer for <i>Non-trivial Elevators: Engineering, Research and Construction</i> (<i>NEERC</i>). His new task is to design a brand new elevator for a skyscraper with <i>h</i> floors.</p><p>Edward has an idée fixe: he thinks that four buttons are enough to control the movement of the elevator. His last proposal suggests the following four buttons:</p><ul><li>Move <i>a</i> floors up.</li><li>Move <i>b</i> floors up.</li><li>Move <i>c</i> floors up.</li><li>Return to the first floor.</li></ul><p>Initially, the elevator is on the first floor. A passenger uses the first three buttons to reach the floor she needs. If a passenger tries to move <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> or <i>c</i> floors up and there is no such floor (she attempts to move higher than the <i>h</i>-th floor), the elevator doesn’t move.</p><p>To prove his plan worthy, Edward wants to know how many floors are actually accessible from the first floor via his elevator. Help him calculate this number.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line of the input file contains one integer <i>h</i> — the height of the skyscraper (1 ≤ <i>h</i> ≤ 10<sup>18</sup>).</p><p>The second line contains three integers <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> — the parameters of the buttons (1 ≤ <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> ≤ <nobr>100 000</nobr>).</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Output one integer number — the number of floors that are reachable from the first floor.</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">15
