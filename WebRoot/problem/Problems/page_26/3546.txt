The human player has to put 10 ships on the field. Each ship occupies from 1 to 4 cells of the field and has sizes 1xK or Kx1, where K is between 1 and 4. The human player has to put into the field: one 4-cell ship, two 3-cell ships, three 2-cell ships and four 1-cell ships. None of the two of the ships can touch each other even by diagonal. Neither can a ship touch the border of the field.
