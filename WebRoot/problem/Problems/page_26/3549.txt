</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Mr. X wants to travel from a point <i>A</i>(X<sub>a</sub>, Y<sub>a</sub>) to a point <i>B</i>(X<sub>b</sub>, Y<sub>b</sub>), <i>A</i> ≠ <i>B</i>. He has a GSM mobile phone and wants to stay available during whole the trip. A local GSM operator has installed <b>K</b> sets of GSM equipment in points <i>P</i><sub>i</sub>(X<sub>i</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub>),&nbsp; 1 ≤ i ≤ <b>K</b>. Each set of the equipment provides circular zone <i>Z</i><sub>i</sub>. Point <i>P</i><sub>i</sub> is the center of the zone <i>Z</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>i</sub> is its radius. Mobile phones can operate inside such a zone and on its border. Zones can intersect, but no zone completely includes another one. </p><p>Your task is to find the length of the shortest way from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> which is completely covered by GSM zones. You may assume that such a way always exists. Precision of calculations has to be 0.00001.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line contains four floating point numbers X<sub>a</sub> Y<sub>a</sub> X<sub>b</sub> Y<sub>b</sub>, separated by one or more spaces.
