</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Deterministic Final-State Automaton (DFA) is a directed multigraph whose vertices are called <i>states</i> and edges are called <i>transitions</i>. Each DFA transition is labeled with a single letter. Moreover, for each state <i>s</i> and each letter <i>l</i> there is at most one transition that leaves <i>s</i> and is labeled with <i>l</i>. DFA has a single <i>starting</i> state and a subset of <i>final states</i>. DFA defines a language of all words that can be constructed by writing down the letters on a path from the starting state to some final state.</p><p>Given a language with a finite set of words it is always possible to construct a DFA that defines this language. The picture on the left shows such DFA for the language consisting of three words: <tt>fix</tt>, <tt>foo</tt>, <tt>ox</tt>. However, this DFA has 7 states, which is not optimal. The DFA on the right defines the same language with just 5 states.</p><div align="center"><img src="images/3576_1.gif"></div><p>Your task is to find the minimum number of states in a DFA that defines the given language.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line of the input file contains a single integer number <i>n</i> (1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ <nobr>5 000</nobr>) — the number of words in the language.
