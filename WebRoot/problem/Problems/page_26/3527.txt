</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>You may have had fun with the popular board game Connect Four, especially if you are using GNOME or KDE, where the game comes under the name Four-in-a-Row or KFourInLine. Wikipedia describes the game as saying,</p><blockquote><p>“Connect Four (also known as Plot Four, Four in a Row, and Four in a Line) is a two-player board game in which the players take turns in dropping alternating colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. The object of the game is to connect four singly-colored discs in a row -- vertically, horizontally, or diagonally -- before your opponent can do likewise.”</p></blockquote><p>The game was solved in 1988 by James D. Allen, and independently by Victor Allis. The first player can force a win with perfect play.</p><p>Slightly generalizing the game, we now use a <i>m</i>-column, <i>n</i>-row grid in the game. Starting from any legal position, can you decide whether any player can force a win or the game will end in a draw?</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> (1 ≤ <i>m</i>, <i>n</i> ≤ 10). Next come <i>n</i> lines each containing a string of <i>m</i> characters, which describes a legal position in the game. We use black (‘<tt>B</tt>’) and white (‘<tt>W</tt>’) discs in this problem. Unoccupied positions in the grid is denoted by periods (‘<tt>.</tt>’). At most 40 or 60% of all positions are unoccupied.</p><p>The first player always plays black discs when the game starts, but the given position may be continued with the second player playing first.</p></div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>If the first player, who plays black discs, can force a win, output “<tt>Black Wins!</tt>”; if the second player, who plays white discs, can force a win, output “<tt>White Wins!</tt>”; otherwise, output “<tt>Draw!</tt>”</p></div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">4 5
