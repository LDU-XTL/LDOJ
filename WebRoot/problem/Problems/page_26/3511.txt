</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>In a letter dated December 25, 1640; the great mathematician Pierre de Fermat wrote to Marin Mersenne that he just proved that an odd prime <i>p</i> is expressible as <i>p</i> = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> if and only if <i>p</i> is expressible as <i>p</i> = 4<i>c</i> + 1. As usual, Fermat didn’t include the proof, and as far as we know, never wrote it down. It wasn’t until 100 years later that no one other than Euler proved this theorem. To illustrate, each of the following primes can be expressed as the sum of two squares:</p><table align="center"><tr><td style="width: 8em;">5 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup></td><td style="width: 8em;">13 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup></td><td style="width: 8em;">17 = 4<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup></td><td style="width: 8em;">41 = 5<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup></td></tr></table><p>Whereas the primes 11, 19, 23, and 31 cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares. Write a program to count the number of primes that can be expressed as sum of squares within a given interval.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.
