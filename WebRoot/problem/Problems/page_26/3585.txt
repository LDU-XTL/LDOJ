</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>Trees are an important component of the natural landscape because of their prevention of erosion and the provision of a specific ather-sheltered ecosystem in and under their foliage. Trees have also been found to play an important role in producing oxygen and reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as well as moderating ground temperatures. They are also significant elements in landscaping and agriculture, both for their aesthetic appeal and their orchard crops (such as apples). Wood from trees is a common building material. </p><p>Trees also play an intimate role in many of the world&#39;s mythologies. Many scholars are interested in finding peculiar properties about trees, such as the center of a tree, tree counting, tree coloring. A(<i>x</i>) is one of such properties.</p><p>A(<i>x</i>) (accumulation degree of node <i>x</i>) is defined as follows:</p><p></p><ol><li>Each edge of the tree has an positive capacity.</li><li>The nodes with degree of one in the tree are named terminals.</li><li>The flow of each edge can&#39;t exceed its capacity.</li><li><i>A</i>(<i>x</i>) is the maximal flow that node <i>x</i> can flow to other terminal nodes.</li></ol><p>Since it may be hard to understand the definition, an example is showed below:</p><p><img src="images/3585_1.PNG" /></p>
