The humans now depend on their ultimate weapon to retain their last hope of survival. The weapon, while capable of creating a continuous, closed and convex lethal region in the space and annihilating everything enclosed within, unfortunately exhausts upon each launch a tremendous amount of energy which is proportional to the surface area of the lethal region. </p><p>Given the positions of all battleships in the Aliens' armada, your task is to calculate the minimum amount of energy required to destroy the armada with a single launch of the ultimate weapon.
