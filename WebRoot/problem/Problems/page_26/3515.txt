Here’s the solution:</p><div align="center"><img src="images/3515_2.png"></div></p>Write a program to solve similar puzzles knowing that:</p><ol><li>Each puzzle is made of a left operand, an operator, a right operand, an equal sign, and a result. The two operands and the result are numbers, made of one or more digits, and is less than 2<sup>31</sup>.</li><li>The operator and the equal sign cannot be changed. You’re only allowed to move sticks making up the digits.</li><li>You can neither remove digits completely nor introduce new ones. (i.e. You can only <i>alter the digits</i>.)</li><li>Leading zeros are allowed in both the input and output. Leading zeros in the output must be printed.</li><li>Each puzzle specifies the number of required moves. Your solution must move as many sticks as specified. A stick is moved at most once; It cannot be moved again. If a stick is moved, its original place must remain vacant. (i.e. you cannot move another stick to that place.)</li><li>When solving a puzzle involving division, the division must be an <i>exact integer division</i>, i.e. no remainder.</li><li>Digits are “written” as follows:<div align="center"><img src="images/3515_3.png"></div></li></ol></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.
