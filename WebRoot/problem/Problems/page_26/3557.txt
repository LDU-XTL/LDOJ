</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The scene of the new computer game “Battles in Space: Unification” (<i>BSU</i>) is laid in far future. Mankind is scattered on <b>N</b> planets hostile to each other. A player of the game is a leader of one the planets. Using diplomatic tricks and military the player needs to occupy the rest of the planets and, doing so, reunite mankind.</p><p>Special <i>hyperspace tunnels </i>are used to travel from one planet to another. Each tunnel connects two of the planets and can be used for communication in both directions. Two planets <b>can not</b> be connected by more then one tunnel. The set of all tunnels connecting the planets is called <i>the map of the game</i>.</p><p>Currently, developers of <i>BSU</i> are working on generator of maps of the game. It has been decided to use the special algorithm called «Fine Artificial Model of Intelligence» (<i>FAMI</i>) for this purpose. The algorithm operates in the following way. For each pair of planets <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> (1 ≤ <b>i </b>&lt; <b>j </b>≤ <b>N</b>) a random real number <b>X<sub>ij</sub></b> (0 ≤ <b>X<sub>ij</sub></b><sub> </sub>≤ 1) is generated. Uniform distribution is used to generate random numbers and numbers <b>X<sub>ij</sub></b> are generated independently. Next, if <b>X<sub>ij </sub></b>≤ <b>P</b>, where parameter <b>P</b> is a real number, then the hyperspace tunnel connecting planets <b>i</b> and <b>j </b>is added into the map being generated.</p><p>Developers wish the map generator produced <i>connected </i>maps. A map is said to be <i>connected </i>when between any pair of planets there is a path, consisting of one or more hyperspace tunnels. Unfortunately, it appears that maps generated by <i>FAMI</i> algorithm sometimes are not <i>connected</i>. You are assigned to research this phenomenon.</p><p>You need to write a program which being given numbers <b>N</b> and <b>P</b> calculates probability of generating <i>connected</i> map by <i>FAMI</i> algorithm.</p></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The input consists of two lines.
