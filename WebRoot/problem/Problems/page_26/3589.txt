</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><div><p>Larry likes playing the number-guessing game.</p><p>Two players are needed in a game. Suppose they are X and Y, and X presents a number for Y to guess. Firstly, X chooses a number with four different digits, keeping it in mind, and tells Y to start guessing. Every time Y has guessed, X should give out *A*B to show Y how close to the number his answer is. Here the symbol * stands for a number, and the number before A is the number of digits in Y&#39;s answer with both correct value and position. The number before B is the number of digits in Y&#39;s answer with correct value but incorrect position.</p><p>For example, if X chooses the number 5204, and Y guesses 4902, then X should give out 1A2B, in which 1A corresponds for digit 0 with both correct value and position and 2B corresponds for digit 2 and 4 with correct value but incorrect position. Then Y will go on guessing according to 1A2B that X presents him until he gets the totally correct number 5204 (when X shows him 4A0B).</p><p>Now you are given two numbers, and what you need to do is just testing how close they are.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line of the input is an integer <i>T</i> which indicates the number of test cases.
