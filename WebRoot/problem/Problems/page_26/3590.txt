Now suppose there are 5 cards, and a case of shuffle is &lt;5, 3, 2, 1, 4&gt;, then the shuffle will be:</p><p>Before shuffling：1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>The 1st shuffle：5, 3, 2, 1, 4<br>The 2nd shuffle：4, 2, 3, 5, 1<br>The 3rd shuffle：1, 3, 2, 4, 5<br>The 4th shuffle：5, 2, 3, 1, 4<br>The 5th shuffle：4, 3, 2, 5, 1<br>The 6th shuffle：1, 2, 3, 4, 5(the same as it is in the beginning)</p><p>You'll find that after six shuffles, the cards' order returns the beginning. In fact, there is always a number <i>m</i> for any case of shuffling that the cards' order returns the beginning after <i>m</i> shuffles. Now your task is to find the shuffle with the largest <i>m</i>. If there is not only one, sort out the one with the smallest order.</p></div></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US"><p>The first line of the input is an integer <i>T</i> which indicates the number of test cases.
