</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Given a two-dimensional array of positive and negative integers, a sub-rectangle is any contiguous sub-array of size 1*1 or greater located within the whole array. The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the elements in that rectangle. In this problem the sub-rectangle with the largest sum is referred to as the maximal sub-rectangle.
<br>As an example, the maximal sub-rectangle of the array:
<br>
<br> 0 -2 -7  0
<br> 9  2 -6  2
<br>-4  1 -4  1
<br>-1  8  0 -2
<br>is in the lower left corner:
<br>
<br> 9  2
<br>-4  1
<br>-1  8
<br>and has a sum of 15.
<br></div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of an N * N array of integers. The input begins with a single positive integer N on a line by itself, indicating the size of the square two-dimensional array. This is followed by N^2 integers separated by whitespace (spaces and newlines). These are the N^2 integers of the array, presented in row-major order. That is, all numbers in the first row, left to right, then all numbers in the second row, left to right, etc. N may be as large as 100. The numbers in the array will be in the range [-127,127].</div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Output the sum of the maximal sub-rectangle.</div><p class="pst">Sample Input</p><pre class="sio">4
