</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The  left  figure below  shows a complete  3*3  grid made with  2*(3*4) (=24)  matchsticks. The  lengths of all matchsticks are one. You can find many squares of different sizes in the grid. The size of a square is the length of its side. In the grid shown in the left figure, there are 9 squares of size one, 4 squares of size two, and 1 square of size three.  
<br> 
<br>Each matchstick of the complete grid is identified with a unique number which is assigned from left to right and from top to bottom as shown in the left figure. If you take some matchsticks out from the complete grid, then  some  squares  in  the  grid will  be  destroyed, which  results  in  an  incomplete  3*3  grid. The  right  figure illustrates  an  incomplete  3*3  grid  after  removing  three  matchsticks  numbered  with  12,  17  and  23.  This removal destroys 5 squares of size one, 3 squares of size two, and 1 square of size three. Consequently, the incomplete grid does not have squares of size three, but still has 4 squares of size one and 1 square of size two.

<br>As  input,  you  are  given  a  (complete  or  incomplete)  n*n  grid  made  with  no  more  than  2n(n+1) matchsticks for a natural number  5 <= n . Your task is to compute the minimum number of matchsticks taken 
<br>out to destroy all the squares existing in the input  n*n  grid.  </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of   T test cases. The number of  test cases  (T )  is given  in  the  first  line of  the  input  file. 
<br>Each  test  case  consists  of  two  lines: The  first  line  contains  a  natural  number  n ,  not  greater  than  5, which implies  you  are  given  a  (complete  or  incomplete)  n*n  grid  as  input,  and  the  second  line  begins  with  a nonnegative integer  k , the number of matchsticks that are missing from the complete  n*n  grid, followed by 
<br>k numbers specifying the matchsticks. Note that if  k  is equal to zero, then the input grid is a complete  n*n grid; otherwise, the input grid is an incomplete  n*n  grid such that the specified  k  matchsticks are missing from the complete  n*n  grid. </div><p class="pst">Output</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Print  exactly one  line  for each  test  case.
