</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">Consider polynomials whose coefficients are 0 and 1. Addition of two polynomials is achieved by 'adding' the coefficients  for  the  corresponding  powers  in  the polynomials. The  addition  of  coefficients  is  performed  by addition modulo 2, i.e., (0 + 0) mod 2 = 0, (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1, (1 + 0) mod 2 = 1, and (1 + 1) mod 2 = 0. Hence, it is the same as the exclusive-or operation. 
<br>
<br>(x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) + (x^7 + x + 1) = x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^2  
<br>
<br>Subtraction of two polynomials is done similarly. Since subtraction of coefficients is performed by subtraction modulo  2  which  is  also  the  exclusive-or  operation,  subtraction  of  polynomials  is  identical  to  addition  of polynomials. 
<br> 
<br>  (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) - (x^7 + x + 1) = x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^2  
<br> 
<br>Multiplication of two polynomials is done in the usual way (of course, addition of coefficients is performed by addition modulo 2). 
<br> 
<br>(x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) (x^7 + x + 1)  =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1 
<br> 
<br>Multiplication of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) modulo a polynomial h(x) is the remainder of f(x)g(x) divided by h(x). 
<br> 
<br>(x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) (x^7 + x + 1) modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1) =  x^7 + x^6 + 1 
<br>The largest exponent of a polynomial is called its degree. For example, the degree of x^7 + x^6 + 1 is 7. 
<br> 
<br>Given three polynomials f(x), g(x), and h(x), you are to write a program that computes f(x)g(x) modulo h(x). 
<br>We assume that the degrees of both f(x) and g(x) are less than the degree of h(x).  The degree of a polynomial is less than 1000. 
<br> 
<br>Since  coefficients  of  a  polynomial  are  0  or  1,  a  polynomial  can  be  represented  by  d+1  and  a  bit  string  of length  d+1,  where  d  is  the  degree  of  the  polynomial  and  the  bit  string  represents  the  coefficients  of  the polynomial. For example, x^7 + x^6 + 1 can be represented by 8 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1. </div><p class="pst">Input</p><div class="ptx" lang="en-US">The input consists of T test cases.
